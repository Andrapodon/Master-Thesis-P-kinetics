  abstract = {Italy is the largest rice-producing country in the European Union: more than two-thirds of Europe's rice with about 60\% of the national production exported, mainly to Mediterranean countries and Eastern Europe. Rice production started around the middle of the fifteenth century, influencing Italian distinguished cuisine. Specialized cultivation is higly skilled and accounts for 70–80\% of the global rice farming surface. The crop is grown from April to October and extends over about 240 000 ha (1.4\% of the total arable area of the country). The expected production is approximately 1.4 million tonnes (MT) of paddy rice; average yield is about 6 t ha‾¹, 85\% of the surface being cropped with Japonica-type varieties, the rest with Thaibonnet. In last 20 years, the cultivation area has increased by about 20\%, making Italy an important riceexporting country, as the volume of exports reached 5\% of total rice traded in the world and domestic consumption hardly exceeds 40\% of total production. The main constraints in Italy are low temperature (at sowing and flowering time), diseases, weeds and red rice. Recent research has proved that the possibility exists to increase potential yield by means of varietal improvement, with emphasis on disease and lodging resistance, and better low-temperature and dry-conditions adaptability.},

  abstract = {Two surface soils (Patua and Tokomaru) of contrasting mineralogy were incubated with several levels of either CaCO3 or HC1. The effects of ionic strength on pH, on surface charge, and on the adsorption of phosphate and sulphate were measured in three concentrations of NaCl. The pH at which the net surface charge was zero (point of net zero charge—PZC) was 1.8 for the Tokomaru soil and 4.6 for the Patua soil: differences that can be related to mineralogical composition. There was an analogous point of zero salt effect (PZSE) that occurred at pH 2.8 for the Tokomaru soil and at 4.6 for the Patua soil. The presence of permanent negative charge in the Tokomaru soil resulted in an increase in PZSE over PZC. The effect of ionic strength on adsorption varied greatly between phosphate and sulphate. For phosphate, there was a characteristic pH above which increasing ionic strength increased adsorption and below which the reverse occurred. This pH (PZSE for adsorption) was higher than the PZC of the soil and was 4.1 for the Tokomaru soil and 5.3 for the Patua soil. In contrast, increasing ionic strength always decreased sulphate adsorption and the adsorption curves obtained in solutions of different ionic strengths converged above pH 7.0. If increasing ionic strength decreases adsorption, the potential in the plane of adsorption must be positive. Also, if increasing ionic strength increases adsorption, the potential must be negative. This suggests that, depending upon pH, phosphate is adsorbed when the potential in the plane of adsorption is either positive or negative, whereas sulphate is absorbed only when the potential is positive.},

  abstract = {ÐZusammenfassung Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is a major source of P for plants. In practice, however, plant-available P is assessed by chemical extractions solubilizing a mixture of P forms the availability of which is ill defined. We undertook an isotopic approach to assess the exchangeability of P extracted by (1) CO2-saturated water (P-CO2), (2) ammonium acetate EDTA (P-AAEDTA), and (3) sodium bicarbonate (PNaHCO3) compared to the exchangeability of P extracted by water. Five topsoils with similar P-fertilization histories but different soil properties were studied. Phosphorus was extracted from soils labeled with carrier-free 33P after 1 week of incubation, and the specific activity (SA = 33P / 31P) of the extracts was compared with the SA of P extracted by water to calculate the amount of P isotopically exchangeable that had been solubilized during the extraction. P-CO2 extracted between 20 and 100 times less P than P-AAEDTA and PNaHCO3. The SA of P-CO2 was not different from the SA of water-extractable P, showing that P-CO2 solubilized similar forms of P as water and that these forms can be considered as available. The SA of P extracted by the two other methods ranged between 25\% and 63\% for P-AAEDTA and 66\% and 92\% for P-NaHCO3 of the SA of water-extractable P. The fraction of exchangeable P extracted by AAEDTA decreased linearly with increasing soil pH, suggesting that this method dissolves slowly or non-exchangeable P from calcium phosphates.},

  abstract = {Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is the main source of P for most crops. The amount of P that is located on the solid phase of a soil and that can exchange with P in the soil solution can be calculated knowing the concentration of water-extractable P (CP) and two kinetic parameters: (i) the ratio between the total introduced radioactivity added as 33P in a soil/water system and the radioactivity remaining after 1 min in this solution (R/r1minute) and (ii) the rate of disappearance of 33P from the solution with time (n). The aim of this article was to propose statistical models describing R/r1minute and n as a function of CP and other soil properties. By doing so we made the hypothesis that it is possible, knowing CP and selected soil properties, to calculate the amount of P located on the solid phase of the soil that remains isotopically exchangeable after 1 min and 60 min (Pr1minute, Pr60minutes). This work was done in two steps. First, isotopic exchange kinetic experiments were carried on nine soil samples (set A) sampled in 1998 that had been incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of water-soluble P. Results from these experiments allowed development of models to calculate R/r1minute as a function of CP, soil pH, and dithionite-extractable Fe (Fed) and n as a function of CP. In the second step, we compared R/r1minute, n, Pr1minute, and Pr60minutes values obtained from the isotopic exchange kinetic experiments conducted on an independent set of 27 soil samples (set B) to the values computed from our statistical models. Modeled and experimental values were highly significantly correlated to each other, showing that the three parameters CP, soil pH, and Fed explained more than 75\% of the variability of the experimental results. Experimental and modelled values of R/r1minute and Pr1minute were not different from each other, whereas experimental values of n and Pr60minutes were statistically significantly different from the modeled values. Finally, the limits and applicability of our approach for the development of a pedotransfer function to predict Pr are discussed.},

  abstract = {Sorption behavior and buffering of phosphorus (P) are important, both from an agricultural and an environmental point of view. The objectives of this study were to investigate: (1) the kinetics of the transfer of P from soil to soil solution and assessing P buffering capacity of soils (PBC), as a function of soil solution P; (2) the effect of PBC on soil P status fitted to environmental targets for water quality; (3) the effect of PBC on crop response. PBC was derived from the non-linear Q-I curve describing the time-dependent relationship between plant-available reserve of soil P (Q) versus soil solution P (I). The Q-I curve was determined in soil suspension using sorption and isotopic dilution methods for soil samples from French, Swedish, and Dutch field trials. Soils with low PBC values were more sensitive to the loss of P to the environment, required higher critical value in soil solution P to comply with P demand of maize, and had higher change in soil solution P per unit of P budget. In different soils, both the critical soil solution P for maize and the change in soil solution P per unit of P balance varied inversely with PBC. It is concluded that (1) PBC plays a key role in determining the agronomic and environmental threshold levels of available P content in the soils, and (2) PBC is a prerequisite for the development of more environmentally oriented fertilization recommendation systems.},

  abstract = {Sorption behavior and buffering of phosphorus (P) are important, both from an agricultural and an environmental point of view. The objectives of this study were to investigate: (1) the kinetics of the transfer of P from soil to soil solution and assessing P buffering capacity of soils (PBC), as a function of soil solution P; (2) the effect of PBC on soil P status fitted to environmental targets for water quality; (3) the effect of PBC on crop response. PBC was derived from the non-linear Q-I curve describing the time-dependent relationship between plant-available reserve of soil P (Q) versus soil solution P (I). The Q-I curve was determined in soil suspension using sorption and isotopic dilution methods for soil samples from French, Swedish, and Dutch field trials. Soils with low PBC values were more sensitive to the loss of P to the environment, required higher critical value in soil solution P to comply with P demand of maize, and had higher change in soil solution P per unit of P budget. In different soils, both the critical soil solution P for maize and the change in soil solution P per unit of P balance varied inversely with PBC. It is concluded that (1) PBC plays a key role in determining the agronomic and environmental threshold levels of available P content in the soils, and (2) PBC is a prerequisite for the development of more environmentally oriented fertilization recommendation systems.},

  abstract = {We studied the effects of poultry manure and pistachio compost with and without phosphorus fertilizer on the kinetics of phosphorus desorption in two calcareous soils of Kerman and Koohbanan farms in the southeastern of Iran. For this purpose mono potassium phosphate, at rates of 0, and 100 parts per million of phosphorus, and airdried manure, at rates of 0 and 4\% were mixed with the soils. The soils were incubated at 24–25°C and near field capacity for 90 days in the greenhouse. Afterwards, the desorption of P was studied by the successive extraction with 0.5 M NaHCO3. The results of this research indicated that application of OM and fertilizer P combined increased P recovery in each of the extraction time, adding poultry manure and 100 mg phosphorus together to the soils, increased P desorption more than pistachio compost in the soils. The phosphorus desorption rate was initially rapid and then became slower until equilibrium was approached. Kinetic data were best described by power function and simple Elovich equations. Subsequent to these equations, parabolic diffusion equation was also well fitted the timedependent P desorption data.},

  abstract = {Climate change will strongly influence agricultural practices in the future. In order to promote resource-efficient agriculture, it is important to analyse the impact of climate variation on crop yields. In this study, we report yields of spring wheat, winter barley, maize, potato and sugar beet from the long-term crop rotation and fertilization experiment Demo in Switzerland and analyze their response to different climate variables (e.g., annual and seasonal temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall). In addition, we investigate the impact of readily plant-available soil potassium (K) on the relationship of crop yields and precipitation. Annual and summer temperatures increased by 1 ◦C and 1.5 ◦C, respectively, over the observation period, and both the number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall increased in summer. Rising summer temperatures have a negative impact on all crop yields, which was most prominent for spring wheat, potato and maize. Annual, spring and summer precipitation show varying effects on different crops. For maize, soil K has a mediating effect on yield reductions under low spring precipitation. Yields are significantly reduced by 1 t ha 1 per 100 mm reduction of precipitation below a soil K threshold of 7 mg K kg 1 soil. Based on these results and the future climate scenarios for Switzerland, crop rotations with less heat-sensitive species and earlymaturing varieties should be considered. In order to keep future irrigation demands and costs as low as possible, the soil K fertility classes in the Swiss K fertilization guidelines might need to be revisited. Our study is one of a few long-term observations that show the impact of climate variation on crop yields and highlights the potential of K management as a climate change adaptation measure.},

  abstract = {Stoichiometric approaches have been applied to understand the relationship between soil organic matter dynamics and biological nutrient transformations. However, very few studies have explicitly considered the effects of agricultural management practices on the soil C : N : P ratio. The aim of this study was to assess how different input types and rates would affect the C : N : P molar ratios of bulk soil, organic matter and microbial biomass in cropped soils in the long term. Thus, we analysed the C, N, and P inputs and budgets as well as soil properties in three long-term experiments established on different soil types: the Saria soil fertility trial (Burkina Faso), the Wagga Wagga rotation/stubble management/soil preparation trial (Australia), and the DOK (bio-Dynamic, bio-Organic, and “Konventionell”) cropping system trial (Switzerland). In each of these trials, there was a large range of C, N, and P inputs which had a strong impact on element concentrations in soils. However, although C : N : P ratios of the inputs were highly variable, they had only weak effects on soil C : N : P ratios. At Saria, a positive correlation was found between the N : P ratio of inputs and microbial biomass, while no relation was observed between the nutrient ratios of inputs and soil organic matter. At Wagga Wagga, the C : P ratio of inputs was significantly correlated to total soil C : P, N : P, and C : N ratios, but had no impact on the elemental composition of microbial biomass. In the DOK trial, a positive correlation was found between the C budget and the C to organic P ratio in soils, while the nutrient ratios of inputs were not related to those in the microbial biomass. We argue that these responses are due to differences in soil properties among sites. At Saria, the soil is dominated by quartz and some kaolinite, has a coarse texture, a fragile structure, and a low nutrient content. Thus, microorganisms feed on inputs (plant residues, manure). In contrast, the soil at Wagga Wagga contains illite and haematite, is richer in clay and nutrients, and has a stable structure. Thus, organic matter is protected from mineralization and can therefore accumulate, allowing microorganisms to feed on soil nutrients and to keep a constant C : N : P ratio. The DOK soil represents an intermediate situation, with high nutrient concentrations, but a rather fragile soil structure, where organic matter does not accumulate. We conclude that the study of C, N, and P ratios is important to understand the functioning of cropped soils in the long term, but that it must be coupled with a precise assessment of element inputs and budgets in the system and a good understanding of the ability of soils to stabilize C, N, and P compounds.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung To evaluate the effect of three phosphorus (P) fertilization regimes (no P, P input equivalent to P off-take by crops, P input higher than P offtake) on crop yield, P uptake, and soil P availability, seven field experiments (six in crop rotations, one under permanent grassland) were conducted in Switzerland during nine years (six trials) or 27 years (one trial). Soil total P (Pt), inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po), and the amount of isotopically exchangeable soil P were measured in the 0±20 cm and 30±50 cm layers of the arable soils and in the 0±10 cm layer of the permanent grassland soil. Omitting P fertilization resulted in significant yield decreases only in one field crop trial as the amount of P isotopically exchangeable within one minute (E1min) reached values lower than 5 mg P (kg soil)±1. In the absence of P fertilization Pi decreased on average from 470 to 410 mg P (kg soil)±1 in the upper horizon of 6 sites while Po decreased only at two sites (from 510 to 466 mg P (kg soil)±1 on average). In all the treatments of the trials started in 1989 the E1min values of the upper horizon decreased on average from 15.6 to 7.4 mg P (kg soil)±1 between 1989 and 1998. These decreases were also observed when P inputs were higher than crops needs, showing that in these soils the highest P inputs were not sufficient to maintain the high initial available P levels.

  abstract = {Functional properties of albumins, globulins and starches from lentil and horse gram were determined. The affect of incorporation of proteins in starch suspensions on in vitro digestibility of proteins (IVPD) and rheology of starches were also evaluated. Albumins showed better foaming capacity and foam stability as compared to globulins. Globulins from both the pulses showed higher emulsifying activity index and water absorption capacity than albumins. Globulins from both the pulses showed higher proportion of serine, aspartic acid, alanine, methionine, valine, lysine and proline and lower glutamine, glycine and cystine content as compared to albumins. Globulins showed higher IVPD as compared to albumins for both the pulses. Both albumins and globulins in the presence of starch showed improvement in IVPD. Storage modulus (G0Peak) and loss modulus (G00 Peak) of starches from both the pulses decreased on addition of albumins and globulins; however, greater decrease was observed upon incorporation of globulins. The retrogradation tendency of starch gels from both the pulses decreased on incorporation of both the proteins.},

  abstract = {Lake sediments are known to be a significant source of phosphorus (P) to plankton populations under certain biogeochemical conditions; however, the contribution of sediment organic P (Porg) to internal P loads remains poorly understood. We investigated Porg speciation and bioavailability in sediments collected over multiple months from a shallow, eutrophic bay in Lake Champlain (Missisquoi Bay,VT) using solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) analysis of sediments collected during years with (2008) and without (2007) algal blooms. Sediments collected during bloom onset (July) and peak bloom (August) months contained the largest proportion of enzyme-labile P, whereas pre- and postbloom sediments were primarily composed of nonlabile P. Monoester P to diester P ratios changed with respect to depth, particularly during bloom periods. Monoester P and DNA accumulation, likely from settling particulate matter, began at the onset of the bloom and continued into October 2008 during the postbloom period. The disappearance of inositol hexakisphosphate stereoisomers and the generation of orthophosphate at lower sediment depths was also evident in August 2008. Principal components analysis of EH and NMR species proportions confirmed differences between sediment cores collected during bloom onset and peak bloom, compared with pre- and postbloom sediments. Large enzymelabile and Porg species proportions corresponded to increased sediment P flux and reduced manganese and iron species in porewater. These findings suggest that interseasonal changes in Porg speciation may influence P mobility in sediments and contribute to important feedback dynamics between biological productivity and sediment water interface geochemistry.},

There were significant differences between soils in the total dry matter (DM) yield of Setaria in 10 harvests spreading over a 20-month period. The DM yield of Setaria decreased in the following sequence: Kundor {$>$} Segamat {$>$} Bungor {$>$} Tok Yong {$>$} Durian soils. The response of Setaria to the P treatments was clearly indicated by the DM yield and for each soil TSP was superior to either CIPR or GPR. The RAE of GPR (90\%) was higher than that of CIPR (72\%). However, for the long-term supply of P, both CIPR and GPR were much more cost-effective than TSP, with REE values of 131 and 143\% for CIPR and GPR, respectively.},

Dissolved P turned over in seconds, resin-extractable P in minutes, NaOH-extractable inorganic P in weeks to months, and HCl-extractable P in years to millennia. Furthermore, we show that in arid-zone soils, some primary mineral P remains even after 150 ky of soil development, whereas in humid-zone soils of the same age, all P in all pools has been biologically cycled. The integrative information we provide makes possible a more dynamic, process-oriented conceptual model of P cycling in soils.},

Optimally managing P to improve sustainability outcomes requires a mechanistic understanding of P availability and transfer, alongside high-resolution spatial data. However, it is unclear if current measurement techniques, models, and maps meet the demands for science-informed management. Here, we review recent advances in measuring P fluxes, quantifying P availability, and mapping soil P resources and discuss implications for sustainability outcomes. We find that the understanding of soil P availability has significantly improved but that agronomical applications and climate models are still largely based on outdated concepts. Also, we find that spatial data on soil P resources are highly uncertain, limiting the usefulness of current P maps. We highlight steps to improve existing tools and emphasize that these improvements need to go hand in hand with policy and technological development to successfully address P-related sustainable development goals.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) management in agroecosystems is driven by opposing requirements in agronomy, ecology, and environmental protection. The widely used maintenance P fertilization strategy relies on critical concentrations of soil test P (STP), which should cause the lowest possible impact on the environment while still ensuring optimal yield. While both soil P availability and crop yields are fundamentally related to pedoclimatic conditions, little is known about the extent to which soil and climate variables control critical STP. The official P fertilization guidelines for arable crops in Switzerland are based on empirically derived critical concentrations for two soil test methods (H2O-CO2 and AAE10). To validate those values and evaluate their relation to pedoclimatic conditions, we established nonlinear multivariate multilevel yield response models fitted to long-term data from six sites. The Mitscherlich function proved most suitable out of three functions and model fit was significantly enhanced by taking the multilevel data structure into account. Yield response to STP was strongest for potato, intermediate for barley, and lowest for wheat and maize. Mean critical STP at 95\% maximum yield ranged among crops from 0.15–0.58~mg~kg−1 (H2O-CO2) and 0–36~mg~kg−1 (AAE10). However, pedoclimatic conditions such as annual temperature or soil clay content had a large impact on critical STP, entailing changes of up to 0.9~mg~kg−1 (H2O-CO2) and 80~mg~kg−1 (AAE10). Critical STP for the AAE10 method was also affected by soil pH. Our findings suggest that the current Swiss fertilization guidelines overestimate actual crop P demand on average and that site conditions account for large parts of the variation in critical STP. We propose that site-specific fertilization recommendations could be improved on the basis of agro-climate classes in addition to soil information, which can help to counteract the accumulation of unutilized soil P by long-term P application.},

  abstract = {Inositol phosphate Stereoisomers were isolated from a forest soil and its surface organic horizon of undecomposed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) needles, and also from a desert soil and its surface plant matter of undecomposed velvet mesquite (Prosopis juliflora var. velutina) leaves. Qualitative and preparative paper chromatography, mass spectrometry, infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were the principal methods used to identify the stereochemistry of the inositol moieties. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy proved to be the most useful means of differentiating among the soil and plant inositol phosphates. Myo- and "DL"-chiroinositol phosphates (optical rotation unknown) were found in the pine needles of P. ponderosa and its underlying soil. Myo-, D-chiro-, and muco-inositol phosphates were found in the leaves of P. juliflora var. velutina; however, only myo- and D-chiroinositol phosphates were identified in the underlying desert soil. The presence of D-chiro-inositol phosphate but absence of muco-inositol phosphate in the desert soil poses questions concerning the fate of the latter in the soil. Epimerization reactions involving a cyclic ketone intermediate are considered, which could occur between the muco- and D-chiro-inositol moieties and also between the myo- and D-chiro inositol moieties, in which the isomers in both cases differ in the stereochemistry of only one carbon atom.},

  abstract = {The capability of a soft drink or a juice to erode dental enamel depends not only on the pH of the drink, but also on its buffering effect. As the latter is the ability of the drink to resist a change of pH it may add to the effects of the actual pH. The aim of the present study was to compare the pH and the buffering effect of various soft drinks with their erosive effects and the solubility of apatite. In 18 soft drinks, mineral waters and juices available on the Danish market, pH and the concentrations of calcium, phosphate and fluoride were determined. The buffering effect was determined by titration with NaOH. Human teeth (n = 54) covered with nail varnish except for 3×4–mm windows were exposed to 1.5 liters of the drink for either 7 days or 24 h under constant agitation. The depth of the erosions was assessed in longitudinal sections. The depth was found to vary greatly from 3 mm eroded by the most acidic drinks and fresh orange juice to only slightly affected surfaces by most of the mineral waters. The dissolution of enamel increased logarithmically inversely with the pH of the drink and parallel with the solubility of enamel apatite. Orange juice, pH 4.0, supplemented with 40 mmol/l calcium and 30 mmol/l phosphate did not erode the enamel as the calcium and phosphate saturated the drink with respect to apatite. Generally, the lower the pH the more NaOH was necessary to bring the pH to neutrality. In particular the buffering  effect of the juice was high. For all drinks, no effect of their low fluoride concentrations was observed.},

  abstract = {Dissolution of phosphate rock (PR) in contrasting soils was evaluated by extraction with 0.5 M NaOH following a prewash with 1 M NaCl to remove exchangeable Ca2+. This provides a simple and direct method for measuring the rate and extent of PR dissolution in soils. Dissolution of Sechura phosphate rock (SPR) in six soils was essentially complete at 90 d and the pattern of dissolution could be described by a modified Mitscherlich equation of the form y = A (1 − e-ex), in which y = amount of SPR dissolved at time x; A = asymptote, and c = curvature coefficient. Whereas A varied markedly across soils, c was independent of soil type. This exponential equation formed the basis of a simple model which describes and predicts the dissolution of SPR in soils. By establishing the relationship between A and a range of properties for 30 contrasting soils it was possible to identify those soil parameters that controlled PR dissolution in soil. Percent Ca-saturation, P-sorption capacity, and Ca-exchange capacity of the soil were the three most important parameters influencing SPR dissolution in soils. When a model incorporating these three parameters was tested on soils not used to construct the model, the variance accounted for ranged from 66 to 76\%, depending on the population of soils selected. These parameters determine the concentrations of Ca2+ and H2PO-4 in the soil solution.},

Soil phosphorus was assumed to occur simultaneously in any of four primary phases: water-soluble, physically adsorbed, immobilized (or chemisorbed), and precipitated. The kinetics of reactions which control the transformation of phosphorus between any two of the four phases were considered to be reversible and of Nth order. A range of values for the reaction rate coefficients were used in the model to describe the transport of applied phosphorus in the solution phase during steady water flow through a soil initially devoid of phosphorus.},

  abstract = {Bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) in the agricultural soil constitutes a dangerous risk for the health of both the environment and humans. Especially in the European Union, a large amount of Cd in agricultural topsoil originates from mineral fertilizer application. In this context, the EU has recently adopted the Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 with the aim to establish stricter limits for Cd presence in fertilizer products and to promote a higher use of fertilizers from organic sources. This paper discusses the future implications of the new regulation to limit the presence of cadmium (Cd) in agricultural soils and food products. The Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 represents an important step of the EU circular economy action plan with its aim to encourage the production of low cadmium content fertilizers. This paper focuses on the limits of the Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 and on the need for complementary policy instruments to protect and conserve agricultural soil health. We highlight the recently proposed, and subsequently withdrawn, EU Soil Framework Directive (SFD) as a meaningful complementary policy tool in the context of a renewed effort to pursue protection and conservation of soil health.},

  abstract = {This is the first in a series of papers describing the impact of two decades of no-till in the Oberacker longterm field experiment in Switzerland. The experiment was established in 1994 on a sandy loam and compares two tillage systems, conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing (MP) and no-till (NT). Crops are grown in a six-year rotation, namely peas (Pisum sativum L.)   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)   field beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)   winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)   sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.)   silage maize (Zea mays L.). This study investigated the impact of the two tillage systems on (i) nutrient distribution and storage in the soil profile, (ii) the depth distribution of soil organic carbon and (iii) crop productivity. Soil samples were collected layer-by-layer following cultivation layers and natural soil horizons in a metal frame (0.5 m   0.5 m cross-sectional area) down to 0.5 m depth. The layer boundaries were approximately 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for NT, and 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for MP. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TotN), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), pH, and bulk density were measured for each layer. The nutrient distribution was rather uniform within the plough layer in MP. In NT, there was strong stratification, with higher nutrient concentrations in the upper layers for TotN, K and Mg. This was associated with crop residue retention on the surface and reduced plant uptake due to low pH. In contrast, the distribution of P and Ca in NT was rather uniform in the 0–30 cm layer, with a trend towards maximum concentrations at around 20 cm depth. Total storage of nutrients per ha in the whole soil profile was similar in NT and MP for all nutrients. SOC stocks did not differ between NT and MP, although the depth distribution of SOC concentration was significantly different. The long-term average crop yield was slightly higher in NT than in MP, but the difference was not significant. Crop yield was significantly higher in NT for winter cereals (winter wheat, winter barley) and legumes (field beans and peas), but lower for root and tuber crops (sugar beet, potatoes). It can be assumed that the high crop yields in NT in the Oberacker long-term field experiment are due to the well-balanced crop rotation.},

  abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, a large proportion of the phosphorus (P) in soil is often found within soil organic matter. However, the majority of organic P in soil remains ‘unresolved’ and is largely observed as a ‘broad’ signal within the phosphomonoester region of a solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum on soil extracts. Our aim was to gain insight into the composition of four soils using the transverse relaxation (T2) time of the magnetisation in solution 31P NMR spectroscopy as a probe of their structure. We found the broad signal within the phosphomonoester region rapidly decayed compared to the sharp signals (i.e. myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate) across all soils, which corresponded to the former having a shorter T2 time than the latter, and supports the existence of a broad signal due to supra-/macro-molecular structures. Furthermore, measures of the broad signal's line-width at half peak intensity based on T2 times were found to be less than that obtained from spectral deconvolution fitting. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the broad signal is itself comprised of more than one component. The significance of this is that the chemical nature of a large proportion of soil organic P appears to be structurally complex.},

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to modify the Mehlich 2 (M2) extractant to include Cu among the extractable nutrients, retain or enhance the wide range of soils for which it is suitable and minimize it's corrosive properties. The substitution of nitrate for chloride anions and the addition of EDTA accomplished those objectives. The new extracting solution, already designated Mehlich 3 (M3) is composed of 0.2N CH3COOH - 0.25N NH4N03 - 0.015NNH4F - 0.013NHN03 - 0.001M EDTA. Extractions from 105 soils using M3, M2, Bray 1 (Bl) and Ammonium Acetate (AA) were compared to evaluate the new extractant. The quantity of F extracted by M3 exceeded that by M2 20\% and that by Bl 4\% but the results from all extractions were highly correlated. Extractions of both K and Mg by M3 were 6-8\% higher than those by AA and 3-4\% higher than those by M2, but, again, there was high correlation among methods. Addition of EDTA increased Cu extractions by 170\%, Mn by 50\% and Zn by 25\%. Cu extractions by M3 correlated with those from the Mehlich-Bowling method. High correlations between Mn, as well as Zn, extracted by M3 and M2 were shown.},

  abstract = {Phosphorusinputs must be estimated accurately to optimize the economicreturn to farmers and minimizeP loss from soils to surface waters. Currently, P recommendationsare based on the diagnosis of field crop responses by chemically extracted soil P. However,the inability of chemicalextraction to characterize plant-available P limits the reliability of these recommendationsM. ajorsources of P mobilized by plant roots include P ions in solution andthose fromsoil constituents, whichreplenish and buffer solution. A mechanistic evaluation of soil P supply should therefore be basedon the description of P ion transfer betweensoil constituents and solution. Sorption, desorption, electro-ultrafiltration (EUF),andisotopic exchangestudies showthat an adequatemodelingof this quantity [Q\textasciitilde c\textasciitilde.t\textasciitilde ] of P ions mustaccount for both the concentrationof P ions in soil solution (Cp)andtime (t). In one long-term field experiment, the Q\textasciitilde ev,,\textasciitilde{} description was not affected by crop rotation andmineral fertilization histories; therefore, Qwv,t\textasciitilde changes are fully explained by Cpchanges. In two field experiments, Cp changes were linearly correlated with the cumulative P budget, inputs, and outputs over years. In three field experiments, the soil type effect on the relative maize(Zea maysL.) response curve was taken into account using the ability of soil P to replenish solution P for 1 d. Theresidual variance of this diagnosis is halved comparedto Olsen’s extraction. Although moreinformation is necessary, accuracy is improvedwhensoil testing is based on mobility . of P ions.},

Much of this charge was pH-dependent, but some negative charge was present at pH values as low as 4.0 and small quantities of positive charge were detected at pH values as high as 8.2. Adsorption of phosphate (P) reduced positive charge at low pH and increased negative charge at high pH. The net amount of surface charge per unit of P adsorbed varied with pH and appeared to depend on the mineralogy of the soil.},

Adsorption isotherms were built and electrophoretic and pH measurements were carried out in order to determine the nature of the adsorbent-adsorbate bonds. The quantity of adsorbed compound reached 5.41 umol Pi m\textasciitilde 2, 5.06 umol G1P m'1, and 1.37 umol I6P m\textasciitilde 2. The G1P and I6P were adsorbed on the surface hydroxyls of goethite through their phosphate groups. The proposed adsorption mechanism, notwithstanding the nature of the organic moiety, is a specific adsorption by a ligand exchange between the phosphate groups and the surface reactive hydroxyls. Inner-sphere surface complexes are formed between phosphate groups and Fe. Very little dissolution of the goethite occurred during the adsorption of either of the two ligands (GIF and I6P). Tentative configurations of the formed organophosphate-goetbite complexes are proposed.},

  abstract = {Meeting the crops requirement for phosphorus (P) is crucial to reach the yield potential. Therefore, it is essential to determine soils´ability to supply the crop with P to identify soils in need of P fertilization and to know where P fertilization is redundant. Thirty-two field experiments with increasing rates of mineral P fertilizers (0, 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 kg P ha 1) to spring barley were carried out from 2020 to 2022 on sandy soils developed on marine or non-marine deposits in Jutland, Denmark. Soil P extraction methods representing both intensity (P extracted with demineralized water, P-water or 0.01 M calcium chloride, P-CaCl2) and quantity tests (P extracted with 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, Olsen-P) were evaluated by their relationship with relative yields. The examined soils had pH values between 4.6 and 6.7 and total P contents between 305 and 1309 mg P kg 1 soil. Yield increased after P fertilization on twelve soils in Northern Jutland (relative yields {$<$} 90 \%). Yield responsiveness occurred in all three experimental years despite differences in precipitation and temperatures among the years. Olsen-P contents were not related to yield response, and all responsive soils had moderate or high soil P status according to the Olsen-P test ({$>$}20 mg P kg 1 soil). Contents of P-CaCl2 were significantly related to the relative yields (R2 =0.39), and slightly more of the variation in relative yields was explained by the P-CaCl2 to Olsen-P ratio (R2 =0.43). Ten of the twelve response soils were detected with the suggested critical threshold value of 0.02 for the P-CaCl2 to Olsen-P ratio. Soils responsive to P fertilization on older marine (Yoldia) and moraine deposits had higher contents of amorphous aluminium oxides determined by oxalate extraction than the nonresponsive soils (+41 mmol mmol kg 1), whereas four lowland soils on younger marine (Litorina) deposits responded to P-fertilization despite low contents of oxalate extractable aluminium. We conclude that an additional P intensity test with CaCl2 extraction offered a much better identification of acid sandy soils requiring P fertilization than relying on the Olsen-P test alone.},

It occupies an important place in human nutrition and has rich source of protein, minerals, and vitamins.

These bioactive substances such as phytic acid, phenolic acid, fiber, enzymatic/proteinase inhibitors have significant metabolic and/or physiological effects. The importance of horse gram was well recognized by the folk/alternative/traditional medicine as a potential therapeutic agent to treat kidney stones, urinary diseases, piles, common cold, throat infection, fever etc. The inception of nutraceutical concept and increasing health consciousness the demand of nutraceutical and functional food is increased. In recent years, isolation and utilization of potential antioxidants from legumes including horse gram are increased as it decreases the risk of intestinal diseases, diabetes, coronary heart disease, prevention of dental caries etc. Keeping in view the increasing demand of food having nutraceutical values, the present review ascribed with recent scientific knowledge towards the possibilities of exploring the horse gram, as a source of food and nutraceuticals compounds.},

  abstract = {The isotopic exchange kinetic (IEK) method allows assessing the rate of orthophosphate ions (Pi) exchange between the solid phase and the solution of the soil with time. However, two challenges have to be tackled when using this technique in soils with a very low water extractable Pi concentration (CP) and with a high sorbing capacity for Pi. The first is that current colorimetric methods do not allow quantifying Pi concentrations lower than 10 μg P L−1. While the second challenge is that a significant fractionation between P isotopes may occur in the soil solution system in the presence of soils with high Pi sorption capacity. We assessed here: i) whether concentrating the blue phosphomolybdate complex (BPMC) in hexanol prior to its measurement would allow to lower the detection and quantification limits of Pi, ii) whether a significant isotopic fractionation between 32Pi and 33Pi could occur during IEK experiments conducted in the presence of high Pi sorbing substrates (e.g., pure goethite or Malagasy soils) and iii) whether the IEK method when used in conjunction with the hexanol concentration of the BPMC to measure CP would detect changes in Pi isotopic exchangeability in a ferralsol cropped with upland rice following the input of manure or water soluble fertilizer. The detection and quantification limits of the BPMC concentrated by hexanol were 0.3 and 0.8 μg P L−1, respectively, using a cell of 10 cm length for the colorimetric measurement. The IEK conducted on Pi amended goethite and on Malagasy soils with 32Pi and 33Pi did not show any systematic isotopic fractionation between both isotopes, suggesting that in these soils 31Pi and 32Pi or 33Pi have a similar behavior during isotopic exchange. The analysis of the soils sampled in the field experiment showed a significant increase in the amount of Pi isotopically exchangeable after 1 min only after the application of water soluble P. This increase was paralleled by increases in rice yield and P export by grains demonstrating an increased P availability in this treatment. In conclusion, the IEK method can be used in low P and high Pi sorbing soils as the hexanol concentration method allows measuring very low CP and as the different P isotopes have a similar behavior in the soil/solution system. The IEK experiments conducted in the presence of goethite, however, point out to the necessity of taking into account the dispersion of particles for a proper interpretation of the isotopic data.},

The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.           ,              Transgression of planetary boundaries by human activities have now brought humanity well beyond a “safe operating space.”},

This P source may be especially important in soils with low concentrations of solution and labile Pi. We assessed gross Po mineralization and immobilization using labeling with 33P in four calcareous Alfisols with varying concentrations of Olsen soil test P that were collected from forage fields of dairy farms in Ontario, Canada. Rapid microbial 33P uptake during incubation was found for the soils with the lowest available Pi as indicated by both Olsen soil test P and water-extractable Pi. The tracer incorporation into microbial P after 8 days ranged from 7 to 44\% of applied 33P and was negatively related to water-extractable Pi following a power-type relationship. As concentrations of microbial P were similar in all soils, this suggests faster turnover of P in the microbial biomass at water-extractable Pi below 0.1 mg P kgÀ1 soil. Daily gross Po mineralization rates ranged from 0.2 to 2.8 mg P kgÀ1 soil dÀ1 and contributed 7e56\% of the isotopically-exchangeable P in 8 days. Based on these findings, microbial processes have the potential to make a significant contribution to forage P nutrition.},

Two main processes were distinguished: a fast, reversible phosphate reaction (within 1 day), which can be described by the Langmuir equation, and a precipitation reaction, which can be described by a time-dependent Freundlich equation. The maximum phosphate sorption capacity in the top 50 cm of the soil ranged from 3 to 6 t P2O5·ha−1. About 85\% to 95\% of the maximum amount of P bound was poorly soluble; the remaining portion of bound P determines the ortho-P concentration in soil solution under desorption conditions. The breakthrough curves of the two column experiments were described reasonably well by the proposed process description and the associated parameters, which were derived from batch experiments.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge will be obligatory in Germany from 2029. Phosphorus content determination in sewage sludge is crucial to assess the prescribed recycling rates. Currently, German law regards sample preparation using aqua regia digestion in a microwave or under reflux conditions as well as instrumental phosphorus determination by ICP-OES, ICP-MS, or photometric determination with ammonium molybdate as equivalent. However, it is questionable whether these methods are indeed equivalent regarding phosphorus quantification in sludges near the limit of 20 g/kg for mandatory recycling. To answer this question, 15 sewage sludges of 11 different wastewater treatment plants were investigated with all permitted method (digestion and measurement) combinations. Moreover, one sewage sludge was also examined in an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) with 28 participants. This study shows that the above-mentioned methods differ in some cases significantly but across all method combinations and sludges, phosphorus recovery was between 80 and 121\% after normalization to the grand mean (average of 15 sludges between 85 and 111\%). The ILC and the examination of 15 sludges produced largely similar results. There is a tendency to higher phosphorus recovery after microwave digestion compared to reflux digestion and ICP-OES measurements determine higher phosphorus contents than ICP-MS and photometric phosphorus determination. As a result, the authors recommend ICP-OES determination of phosphorus in sewage sludge after microwave digestion.},

  abstract = {Utilization of horse gram and its flour in legume composite flours and products is limited due to the presence of antinutritional components, poor functional and expansion properties. Enzymatic treatment was used to improve the expansion and functional properties of horse gram to facilitate its use as an ingredient in food processing. Xylanase-mediated depolymerization of cell wall polysaccharides of horse gram lead to the development of a new expanded/popped horse gram. Expansion process of enzyme treated horse gram resulted in increased length (5.3–6.8 mm) and higher yield of expanded grains (63–98\%). The expanded horse gram had lower bulk density, higher protein digestibility and more resistant starch compared to the control raw grains. Dietary fibre content of raw and processed horse gram was in the range of 14.57–16.14\%. High temperature short time (HTST) conditions used during expansion process lowered the levels of phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors by 46\%, 61\% and 92\%, respectively. The flour obtained from xylanase treated and expanded horse gram had higher water (204.3 g/100 g) and oil absorption capacities (98.4 g/100 g) than unprocessed flour, which had 135.8 g/100 g and 74.6 g/100 g, respectively at ambient conditions. There was a decrease in foaming capacity and foam stability in expanded gram flour. However, emulsion stability increased significantly in the processed samples. Thus, the study indicated that nutritional value and flour functionality of horse gram could be improved by processing it into a new expanded product that can be used as an ingredient in food processing.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Many European cropped soils have high soil test P (STP) values in the top soil because of P accumulation over many years of fertilizer application. This should allow to save P fertilizer applications for some years without STP values decreasing to a level that might negatively impact crop yield. However, the way STP develops under omitted P fertilizer application is not well understood. We examined STP development under omitted P fertilizer application for timeframes between 7 and 46\,years on 96 unfertilized treatments (P0 treatments) of 43 European long‐term P field experiments, using five different STP methods. For comparability, values obtained by different STP methods were converted to Olsen‐P concentrations. We fitted exponential decay curves to Olsen‐P data of each P0 treatment defined by initial Olsen‐P values (               Olsen‐P                                i                              ), rates of decrease (               k               ) and asymptotes (               A               ), reflecting minimum obtainable STP. Subsequently, we analysed whether the variables most commonly recorded in experiments, are sufficient to explain the variation in model parameters, these variables being P export, clay content, C               org               and pH as well as average annual temperature and precipitation. We found that out of our predictor variables, soil clay content, precipitation and temperature were showing the most prominent effects on the parameters               Olsen‐P                                i                              ,               A               or               k               . However, the amount of variation explained by the considered variables was too low to potentially facilitate a prediction of STP decrease, and various P0 treatments showed no clear Olsen‐P decrease or unexpectedly high asymptotes. This hints at a strong influence of the P sorption capacity of the soil with often high potential for replenishment from less available P pools. In connection with P introduction from the subsoil or possibly from surrounding plots, the extension of timeframes of omitted P fertilizer application without reaching critical STP values for crop production, might be explainable.

  abstract = {Many European cropped soils have high soil test P (STP) values in the top soil because of P accumulation over many years of fertilizer application. This should allow to save P fertilizer applications for some years without STP values decreasing to a level that might negatively impact crop yield. However, the way STP develops under omitted P fertilizer application is not well understood. We examined STP development under omitted P fertilizer application for timeframes between 7 and 46 years on 96 unfertilized treatments (P0 treatments) of 43 European long-term P field experiments, using five different STP methods. For comparability, values obtained by different STP methods were converted to Olsen-P concentrations. We fitted exponential decay curves to Olsen-P data of each P0 treatment defined by initial Olsen-P values (Olsen-Pi), rates of decrease (k) and asymptotes (A), reflecting minimum obtainable STP. Subsequently, we analysed whether the variables most commonly recorded in experiments, are sufficient to explain the variation in model parameters, these variables being P export, clay content, Corg and pH as well as average annual temperature and precipitation. We found that out of our predictor variables, soil clay content, precipitation and temperature were showing the most prominent effects on the parameters Olsen-Pi, A or k. However, the amount of variation explained by the considered variables was too low to potentially facilitate a prediction of STP decrease, and various P0 treatments showed no clear Olsen-P decrease or unexpectedly high asymptotes. This hints at a strong influence of the P sorption capacity of the soil with often high potential for replenishment from less available P pools. In connection with P introduction from the subsoil or possibly from surrounding plots, the extension of timeframes of omitted P fertilizer application without reaching critical STP values for crop production, might be explainable. Corresponding effects could not be analysed because of lack of data for most P0 treatments, calling for the additional determination of, for example, the maximum P sorption capacity, total P and subsoil P in future experiments.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) fertilizer recommendations of individual countries may differ in many aspects, but often the main principle is to reach or maintain a target range of plant-available P in soil. Within this target P fertility class, the soil is expected to supply enough P to the crop, while P fertilization replaces what is exported by the harvested crop. However, the threshold values of the target P fertility classes are based on a multitude of different soil test P (STP) methods and vary by a factor of up to three, even for countries using the same STP method. This study aimed to provide a comparison of the thresholds of target P fertility classes of different European countries and critical soil test P values (Pcrit; STP below which the average relative yield falls below 95\% due to P insufficiency) derived from the analysis of data from 55 long-term field experiments in eight European countries. To overcome the issue of diverging STP methods, all values were converted to Olsen-P using empirically based conversion equations from the literature. Converted threshold values varied by a factor of up to five. For the experimental data, we fitted multi-level Mitscherlich-type models to determine Pcrit values of unfertilized soils corresponding to 95\% of maximum yield. We found an average Olsen-Pcrit value of 15~mg~P~kg−1 (adj. R² = 0.37; RMSE = 14.1\% relative yield; n~=~2368; 55 experiments), which lies far below several country-specific thresholds of target P fertility classes. Crop-specific analyses resulted in higher Olsen-Pcrit values for sugar beet (22~mg~P~kg−1), potato (19~mg~P~kg−1) and winter rapeseed (18~mg~P~kg−1). Among the texture classes (loam, sand, silt and clay), sandy soils exhibited the highest average Olsen-Pcrit value (22~mg~P~kg−1). We consider a reevaluation of extraordinarily high country-specific thresholds as well as an inclusion of crop type and soil texture (where not already implemented) to be a reasonable measure towards more cost-effective and environment-friendly P fertilization.},

  abstract = {Several chemical and physical properties of 10 phosphate rock (PR) materials of varying reactivity were evaluated. These included North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR), Sechura phosphate rock (SPR), Chatham Rise phosphorite (CRP), Arad phosphate rock (APR), Gafsa phosphate rock (GPR), North Florida phosphate rock (NFPR), Jordanian phosphate rock (JPR), Mexican phosphate rock (MPR), Nauru Island phosphate rock (NIPR), and Makatea Island phosphate rock (MIPR). Concentrations of As and Cd were highest in NCPR and U was higher in APR and CRP than in the other reactive PR materials. Because Cd and U can accumulate in biological systems, it may be necessary to direct more attention towards the likely implications of Cd and U concentrations when evaluating a PR for direct application. Three sequential extractions with 2\% citric acid may be more useful for comparing the chemical solubility of PR materials, particularly for those containing appreciable CaCO3. For each particle-size fraction from {$<$}63 to {$>$}500 μm, SPR was more soluble in 2\% citric acid than was NCPR. The higher solubility of SPR than NCPR in 2\% citric acid, 2\% formic acid, and neutral ammonium citrate possibly results from a higher chemical reactivity rather than from any difference in the surface area presented for dissolution. The poor relationship obtained between surface area and the solubility of the PR materials in the three chemical extractants suggests that surface area plays a secondary role to chemical reactivity in controlling the solubility of a PR in a chemical extractant. A Promesh plot provided an effective method for describing the particle-size characteristics of those PR materials which occurred as sands. Fundamental characteristics, such as mean particle size and uniformity, can readily be determined from a Promesh plot.},

  abstract = {The inositol phosphates are an abundant but poorly understood group of organic phosphorus compounds found widely in the environment. Four stereoisomers of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) occur, although for three of these (scyllo, neo, and D-chiro) the origins, dynamics, and biological function remain unknown, due in large part to analytical limitations in their measurement in environmental samples. We synthesized authentic neo- and D-chiro-IP6 and used them to identify signals from these compounds in three soils from the Falkland Islands. Both compounds resisted hypobromite oxidation and gave quantifiable 31P NMR signals at δ = 6.67 ppm (equatorial phosphate groups of the 4equatorial/2-axial conformer of neo-IP6) and δ = 6.48 ppm (equatorial phosphate groups of the 2-equatorial/4-axial conformer of D-chiro-IP6) in soil extracts. Inositol hexakisphosphate accounted for 46−54\% of the soil organic phosphorus, of which the four stereoisomers constituted, on average, 55.9\% (myo), 32.8\% (scyllo), 6.1\% (neo), and 5.2\% (D-chiro). Reappraisal of the literature based on the new signal assignments revealed that neo- and D-chiro-IP6 occur widely in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These results confirm that the inositol phosphates can constitute a considerable fraction of the organic phosphorus in soils and reveal the prevalence of neo- and D-chiro-IP6 in the environment. The hypobromite oxidation and solution 31P NMR spectroscopy procedure allows the simultaneous quantification of all four IP6 stereoisomers in environmental samples and provides a platform for research into the origins and ecological significance of these enigmatic compounds.},

  abstract = {The inositol phosphates are a group of organic phosphorus compounds found widely in the natural environment, but that represent the greatest gap in our understanding of the global phosphorus cycle. They exist as inositols in various states of phosphorylation (bound to between one and six phosphate groups) and isomeric forms (e.g.               myo               , D–               chiro               ,               scyllo               ,               neo               ), although               myo               –inositol hexakisphosphate is by far the most prevalent form in nature. In terrestrial environments, inositol phosphates are principally derived from plants and accumulate in soils to become the dominant class of organic phosphorus compounds. Inositol phosphates are also present in large amounts in aquatic environments, where they may contribute to eutrophication. Despite the prevalence of inositol phosphates in the environment, their cycling, mobility and bioavailability are poorly understood. This is largely related to analytical difficulties associated with the extraction, separation and detection of inositol phosphates in environmental samples. This review summarizes the current knowledge of inositol phosphates in the environment and the analytical techniques currently available for their detection in environmental samples. Recent advances in technology, such as the development of suitable chromatographic and capillary electrophoresis separation techniques, should help to elucidate some of the more pertinent questions regarding inositol phosphates in the natural environment.},
