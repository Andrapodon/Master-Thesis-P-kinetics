The results of this study are presented in two main parts. First, the development and validation of the phosphorus (P) desorption kinetic model are detailed, justifying the final modeling approach. Second, the descriptive trends of both agronomic outcomes and soil P parameters in response to long-term fertilization and site differences are explored visually. Finally, the predictive power of the kinetic and standard P parameters is formally evaluated using linear mixed-effects models.

## Establishment of the P-Desorption Kinetic Model

The primary goal was to derive two key parameters for each soil sample: the desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) and the rate constant ($k$). The analysis proceeded in two stages: an initial test of a linearized model, followed by the implementation of a more robust non-linear model.

### Initial Approach: Failure of the Linearized Model

Following the conceptual framework of Flossmann and Richter (1982), the first-order kinetic equation was linearized. A core assumption of this model is that the linear relationship must pass through the origin. To test this, linear models were fitted to the transformed data for each sample individually. The results revealed a systematic failure of this assumption, as the estimated intercepts for the majority of samples were highly significantly different from zero (p \< 0.05). This consistent statistical deviation indicated that the linearized approach was not a valid representation of the data. The visual evidence in @fig-linearized-model supports this conclusion.

   geom_smooth(method="lm", alpha = 0.3)
```

### Final Approach: Successful Non-Linear Model

Given the statistical failure of the linearized model, a direct non-linear modeling approach was adopted to estimate both $P_{desorb}$ and $k$ simultaneously from the untransformed data. This approach does not rely on the assumption of a zero intercept and proved to be far more successful, accurately capturing the curvilinear shape of the desorption data for nearly all samples (fig-nonlinear-model). The final parameters were extracted from a non-linear mixed-effects model (`nlme`) to account for the hierarchical data structure. **These final `nlme`-derived coefficients were used for all subsequent analyses.**

## Comparison with Isotopic Exchange Kinetics (IEK)

To validate the newly derived kinetic parameters against an established benchmark, the capacity ($P_{desorb}$) and kinetic ($k$) parameters were compared to data from Isotopic Exchange Kinetics (IEK) studies previously conducted on the same long-term trial sites by Demaria et al. (2013). This comparison aims to determine if the simpler, non-equilibrium desorption method used in this thesis captures similar aspects of soil P dynamics as the more complex, equilibrium-based IEK method.

The size of the desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) was compared against the long-term isotopically exchangeable P pool measured after 7 days ($E_{7d}$). The desorption rate constant ($k$) was compared against the IEK kinetic parameter measured after 24 hours ($n_{1d}$). Spearman's rank correlation was used to robustly test for monotonic trends between the different methods.

correlation_data <- D %>%

  na.omit()

# Step 2: Perform the formal correlation tests
spearman_capacity <- cor.test(correlation_data$PS, correlation_data$E_exp_10080, method = "spearman")
spearman_kinetic <- cor.test(correlation_data$k, correlation_data$n_1440, method = "spearman")

# Step 3: Create the plots

p1 <- ggplot(correlation_data, aes(x = E_exp_10080, y = PS)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue", formula = y ~ x) +
  labs(
    x = TeX("Isotopically Exchangeable P, $E_{7d}$ (mg kg$^{-1}$)"),
    y = TeX("Desorbable P, $P_{desorb}$ (mg L$^{-1}$)")
  ) +
  theme_bw()

# Plot B: Kinetic Comparison
p2 <- ggplot(correlation_data, aes(x = n_1440, y = k)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue", formula = y ~ x) +
  labs(
    x = TeX("IEK Kinetic Parameter, $n_{1d}$"),
    y = TeX("Desorption Rate Constant, $k$ (min$^{-1}$)")
  ) +
  theme_bw()

# Display plots side-by-side (this is handled by the chunk options)

```

The analysis revealed a statistically significant, moderate positive correlation between the capacity parameters, $P_{desorb}$ and $E_{7d}$ (fig-iek-comparison). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was `r round(spearman_capacity$estimate, 2)` with a p-value of `r format.pval(spearman_capacity$p.value, eps = 0.001)`.

Similarly, a statistically significant, moderate positive correlation was found between the kinetic parameters, $k$ and $n_{1d}$ (fig-iek-comparison). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was `r round(spearman_kinetic$estimate, 2)` with a p-value of `r format.pval(spearman_kinetic$p.value, eps = 0.001)`.

These results indicate that the simpler, non-equilibrium desorption method used in this study successfully captures both the capacity and intensity aspects of soil P lability, providing results that are consistent with the more complex, equilibrium-based IEK method reported by Demaria et al. (2013).

## Effects of Fertilization on Agronomic and Soil Parameters {#sec-effects-of-fertilization-on-agronomic-and-soil-parameters}

Having established a robust method to determine the kinetic parameters, the next step was to explore the effects of the long-term P fertilization treatments on both the agronomic outcomes and the soil P test parameters.

### Agronomic Responses to P Fertilization {#sec-agronomic-responses-to-p-fertilization}

The long-term application of different P fertilization levels had a pronounced impact on the primary agronomic outcomes, including two different metrics for yield, P Uptake ($P_{up}$), and P Balance ($P_{bal}$), though the response varied considerably between sites (@fig-agronomic-responses).

**Yield Metrics ($Y_{norm}$ and $Y_{rel}$)**: Both yield metrics showed a generally positive response to P fertilization. The site-normalized yield ($Y_{norm}$) shows the response relative to the site's potential for that year, with most yields plateauing around the Norm (100%) treatment. The national-normalized yield ($Y_{rel}$) provides a broader context, showing how yields at each site compare to the national average.

**P Uptake ($P_{up}$)**: P uptake by crops followed a similar trend to yield, increasing with fertilization, often continuing to increase at the highest fertilization levels, suggesting luxury consumption.

**P Balance ($P_{bal}$)**: The P balance showed a strong, linear relationship with fertilization. The Zero and Deficit treatments resulted in a negative balance (mining soil P), while the Elevated and Surplus treatments led to a significant P surplus.

### Soil P Parameters as a Function of P Fertilization {#sec-soil-p-parameters-as-a-function-of-p-fertilization}

The different soil P test parameters, including the standard STP methods and the newly derived kinetic parameters, all responded to the long-term fertilization treatments (@fig-soil-parameters).

**Standard STPs (**$P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$): Both standard soil P tests showed a clear and consistent increase with rising P fertilization levels across all sites, confirming their sensitivity to management.

**Kinetic Parameters (**$k$, $P_{desorb}$, and $J_0$): 
**Desorbable P ($P_{desorb}$)**: This parameter behaved very similarly to the standard STPs, increasing steadily with P fertilization and confirming its role as a "capacity" indicator.  
**Rate Constant ($k$)**: The rate constant showed a more complex pattern, with no strong, consistent trend with fertilization. This suggests that while fertilization increases the *amount* of available P, it may not change the intrinsic *release rate*.  **Initial P Flux ($J_0$)**: As the product of $P_{desorb}$ and $k$, this parameter integrates both capacity and intensity. It showed a strong positive response to fertilization, driven primarily by the increase in $P_{desorb}$.

These initial observations suggest that the kinetic parameters, particularly the rate constant $k$, may provide unique information about the soil's P dynamics not captured by static tests alone. The next section will use formal statistical models to test these relationships.


## Predicting P Parameters from Soil Properties {#sec-p-params-soil-props}

To understand the underlying drivers of the standard and kinetic P parameters, and to test **Hypotheses 1b and 2b**, a series of linear mixed-effects models were fitted. Each model predicted one of the P parameters based on the core soil properties: organic carbon ($C_{org}$), clay content, silt content, pH, and dithionite-extractable Al ($Al_d$) and Fe ($Fe_d$). The results are summarized in @tbl-soil-prop-models.

The analysis reveals that the capacity-based P pools and the kinetic rate constant are controlled by different sets of soil properties, strongly supporting the hypotheses.

In line with **Hypothesis 2b**, the kinetic capacity parameter, **Desorbable P ($P_{desorb}$)**, showed a highly significant negative relationship with both dithionite-extractable iron ($Fe_d$) and aluminum ($Al_d$). This provides strong evidence that the total pool of free oxides, which represent the primary P sorption surfaces in the soil, is a key factor controlling the size of the readily desorbable P pool.

Also confirming **Hypothesis 2b**, the **Rate Constant (*k*)** was governed by a different set of properties. It was not significantly influenced by the free oxides but instead showed a significant negative relationship with `Clay` content and a positive relationship with organic carbon ($C_{org}$). This clearly distinguishes the kinetic component from the capacity component, suggesting that while oxides control *how much* P can be held, soil texture and organic matter influence *how fast* it can be released.

The standard STP methods showed patterns consistent with **Hypothesis 1b**. **Organic Carbon ($C_{org}$)** had a highly significant positive effect on $P_{AAE10}$, and **pH** had a significant negative effect, as predicted. The relationship of the STP measures with the dithionite-extractable oxides was less consistent than that of $P_{desorb}$, with only $P_{AAE10}$ showing a significant negative link to $Al_d$.

## Predictive Modeling of Agronomic Outcomes {#sec-agronomic-modeling}

To formally evaluate the predictive power of the standard STP methods against the kinetic parameters, a series of linear mixed-effects models were fitted for each of the primary agronomic response variables. To test the central hypotheses of this thesis, the predictive power of the kinetic parameters was directly compared against that of the standard STP methods for several key agronomic outcomes. For each response variable—Normalized Yield ($Y_{rel}$), P Uptake ($P_{up}$), and P Balance ($P_{bal}$)—a set of competing linear mixed-effects models was constructed.

To ensure a fair comparison, all models shared an identical random effects structure (`(1|year) + (1|Site) + (1|Site:block)`), differing only in their fixed effects. Four distinct models were evaluated:
**$P_{CO_2}$ Model:** Used the standard water-soluble P test as the sole predictor.
**$P_{AAE10}$ Model:** Used the standard chelate-extractable P test as the sole predictor.
**STP Interaction Model:** Included both standard tests and their interaction term ($P_{CO_2} * P_{AAE10}$) to capture their combined effect.
**Kinetic Model:** Used the log-transformed desorbable P pool ($log(P_{desorb})$), the rate constant (*k*), and their interaction ($J_0$) as predictors.

The performance of these models for each agronomic outcome is presented in the following sections.

### Anomaly in the Cadenazzo Yield Data

A preliminary visual analysis of the agronomic data revealed a significant anomaly at the Cadenazzo (CAD) site. As shown in @fig-yield-comparison, the Cadenazzo site exhibited substantially higher overall yields than all other locations. More critically, the yield response to P fertilization did not follow the expected agronomic trend. The zero-fertilizer treatment (`P0`) showed the highest median yield, while the surplus treatment (`P166`) was among the lowest.

A simple label swap between `P0` and `P166` was hypothesized and tested (@fig-yield-cadenazzo-fix). While this correction established a more monotonic trend, the resulting pattern remained questionable, with the corrected `P166` yield being inexplicably higher than the `P100` and `P133` treatments, which is not a typical biological response.

Unfortunately, a deeper investigation into the cause of this anomaly was impossible, as the corresponding soil analysis data (STPs, organic carbon, etc.) for the Cadenazzo site were unavailable due to sample loss. Without this data, it cannot be determined whether the issue stems from a persistent micro-site anomaly, a more complex data recording error, or other unknown factors. Given these unresolved inconsistencies and the site's unusually high productivity, the Cadenazzo data was retained in the models but is recognized as a significant source of unexplained variance that likely contributed to the poor predictive performance of all models for yield-related metrics like $Y_{norm}$ and $Y_{rel}$.

The standard STP methods were highly effective predictors. Both the $P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$ models showed highly significant coefficients and explained a substantial portion of the variance, with marginal $R^2$ values of 0.218 and 0.198, respectively. The combined model (STP-interaction) performed best overall, explaining 22% of the variance fixed effects. These results directly contradict **Hypothesis 1a**, which posited that these static measurements would be weak predictors of yield. For predicting yield relative to a site's own maximum potential, the standard soil tests perform very well.

In stark contrast, the kinetic model had virtually no predictive power for $Y_{norm}$. The model's marginal $R^2$ was only 0.014, and none of the kinetic parameters—neither the rate constant (*k*), the desorbable pool ($P_{desorb}$), nor their interaction were statistically significant. This finding strongly refutes **Hypothesis 3** for this specific yield metric. The results suggest that when agronomic potential is evaluated within a single site (the function of site-normalization), the rate of P supply is not the limiting factor; rather, the overall capacity or size of the available P pool, as measured effectively by standard soil tests, is the dominant driver of the yield response.


### Predicting National-Normalized Yield ($Y_{rel}$)

The models predicting national-normalized yield ($Y_{rel}$) reveal that both standard and kinetic soil phosphorus tests struggle to explain the variance in crop yields on their own, though standard tests show slightly better performance in this context.

#### Performance of Standard STP Methods

The models based on standard soil tests ($P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$) individually showed a significant, positive relationship with relative yield. When considered alone, both $P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$ were significant predictors, explaining 7.4% and 6.3% of the variance in yield, respectively (indicated by their marginal $R^2$, $R^2_m$). The model including their interaction term ($P_{CO_2}*P_{AAE10}$) performed slightly better, explaining 7.8% of the variance.

These findings partially align with **Hypothesis 1a**, which posited that standard STP methods would be weak predictors of relative crop yield. The low marginal $R^2$ values confirm that these static measurements account for less than 8% of the yield variation, which is indeed a weak predictive performance.

#### Performance of the Kinetic Model

Contrary to expectations, the model based on kinetic parameters ($k * P_{desorb}$) demonstrated very low predictive power, with a marginal $R^2$ of just 2.2%. Although the desorption rate ($k$) and the initial P flux ($J_0$) showed a significant positive relationship with yield, the overall model performed worse than the standard STP methods.

This result directly contradicts **Hypothesis 3**, which stated that a model incorporating kinetic parameters would explain a significantly greater proportion of the variance in relative yield compared to static STP measurements. For predicting national-normalized yield, the opposite appears to be true; the standard methods, while weak, still outperform the kinetic approach.

#### The Role of Unmeasured Factors

A critical observation across all models is the large discrepancy between the marginal $R^2$ ($R^2_m$) and the conditional $R^2$ ($R^2_c$). The conditional $R^2$ represents the total variance explained by both the fixed effects (the predictors like $P_{CO_2}$ or *k*) and the random effects (such as `Site` and `year`).

For instance, in the best-performing STP model (STP-interaction), the marginal $R^2$ is only 0.078, but the conditional $R^2$ is 0.596. This means that while the soil P measurements themselves explain about 8% of the yield variance, the combination of soil tests *plus* the site- and year-specific conditions explains nearly 60% of it. This pattern holds for all models and strongly suggests that pedoclimatic factors, captured by the `Site` and `year` random effects, are the dominant drivers of crop yield in this dataset, overshadowing the influence of the measured soil P parameters.


### Predicting P-Uptake ($P_{up}$)

When predicting P-uptake, both the standard and kinetic models demonstrate similarly weak predictive power, with none of the approaches standing out as superior.

#### Performance of Standard STP Methods

The standard soil tests, $P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$, when modeled individually, were significant positive predictors of P-uptake. The $P_{AAE10}$ model performed slightly better, explaining 7.3% of the variance ($R^2_m$ = 0.073) compared to the $P_{CO_2}$ model's 6.4% ($R^2_m$ = 0.064). Interestingly, the interaction model did not improve but slightly decreased the explained variance ($R^2_m$ = 0.065), and the individual predictors lost their significance.

These results are consistent with **Hypothesis 1a**, which predicted that standard STP methods would be weak predictors of agronomic outcomes like P-uptake. The low marginal $R^2$ values confirm that these static tests, while statistically significant on their own, account for a very small fraction of the variability in P-uptake by crops.

#### Performance of the Kinetic Model

The kinetic model performed on par with the standard individual tests, explaining 6.4% of the variance in P-uptake ($R^2_m$ = 0.064). However, none of the kinetic parameters (*k*, $P_{desorb}$, or $J_0$) emerged as individually significant predictors.

This finding challenges **Hypothesis 3**, which anticipated that the kinetic parameters would offer significantly improved predictive power. For P-uptake, the kinetic model shows no advantage over the simpler, traditional STP methods. The dynamic measures of P supply do not appear to capture the mechanisms driving P-uptake any better than the static measures in this context.

#### Dominance of Site and Year Effects

As with the yield predictions, there is a vast difference between the marginal $R^2$ and conditional $R^2$ values across all P-uptake models. For example, the kinetic model's marginal $R^2$ is only 0.064, but its conditional $R^2$ is 0.648. This indicates that the fixed effects (the soil P measurements) explain about 6% of the variance, while the random effects (`Site` and `year`) account for the vast majority of the explained variance (around 58%). This again underscores that site-specific pedoclimatic conditions and year-to-year environmental variations are the primary factors controlling P-uptake, with the specific soil P status playing a minor, secondary role


### Predicting P-Balance ($P_{bal}$)

The prediction of the P-Balance ($P_{bal}$) reveals a stark and decisive contrast between the kinetic and standard STP approaches, providing the strongest evidence in favor of the kinetic methodology.

#### Performance of the Kinetic Model

The kinetic model emerged as an exceptionally strong predictor of the P-Balance, explaining 57.2% of the variance ($R^2_m$ = 0.572). The desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) was a highly significant predictor (p < 0.001). This result provides powerful support for the underlying premise of this thesis. The P-Balance represents the net result of P inputs and outputs over time, and the fact that $P_{desorb}$—a measure of the readily available P pool—so accurately reflects this balance is a significant finding.

This strongly supports **Hypothesis 3**, which asserted that kinetic parameters would be more effective predictors than static tests. In the case of P-Balance, the kinetic model is not just an improvement; it is the only effective model.

#### Performance of Standard STP Methods

In stark contrast, all models based on the standard STP methods ($P_{CO_2}$, $P_{AAE10}$, and their interaction) completely failed to predict the P-Balance. Their marginal $R^2$ values were effectively zero ($R^2_m$ = 0.001), indicating they have no predictive power whatsoever for this crucial agronomic metric. None of the STP predictors were statistically significant.

This finding directly contradicts **Hypothesis 1a**, which anticipated a significant correlation between the standard STP methods and the P-Balance. The results show no such relationship exists, suggesting that these static measurements do not adequately reflect the long-term phosphorus status of the soil as represented by the P-Balance.

#### Interpreting the $R^2$ Discrepancy

The dramatic difference in performance is clear from the $R^2$ values. While the conditional $R^2$ for the STP models is high (around 0.81), their marginal $R^2$ is 0.001. This indicates that all the explanatory power comes from the random effects (`Site` and `year`), and the STP measurements themselves contribute nothing. The kinetic model, however, has both a high marginal $R^2$ (0.572) and a high conditional $R^2$ (0.744). This demonstrates that the kinetic parameters are themselves powerful predictors, capturing a large portion of the variance that is independent of site and year effects.
