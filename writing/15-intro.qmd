## Complexity of Phosphorous

Phosphorous displays a wide range of behaviours in soils, in places where organic, mineral and aqueous phases interface. In phases that contain oxygen Phosphorous is almost exclusively present as several derivates of Orthophosphate $PO_4^{3-}$ It can be found as organic molecules as anhydric- and ester-groups, being needed by all known species as a constituent of DNA and energy transfer-processes. It can be present as anorganic Phosphate either as mono-orthophosphate $PO_4^{3-}$ or poly-orthophosphate $HO-(PO_2)_n-OH$, where it can strongly interact with water, forming, depending on pH $HPO_4^{2-}$ or $H_2PO_4^{-}$. The dissolved species of phosphate are subject to adsorption to clay- and oxide-surfaces of the solid soil-phase, they also form fallout-products such as Apatite, Vivianite etc. With the present metal-cations in the solution. While the solubility constant of most phosphate-salts are comparably low (Wert eingeben), meaning that the fallout and formation of minerals happens at low chemical activities of phosphate, phosphate often is leached from soil-surface-layers, heavily reducing the efficacy of P-fertilization and presenting a disturbance to P-limited ecosystems. Those phenomena, many of them being physicochemically controlled, are influenced by parameters such as pH, ionic-strength, clay-content, specific-surface of the solid phase, amorphous $Fe(OH)_3$-content amorphous $Al(OH)_3$-content, in short the phenomena depend heavily on the composition, distribution and geometry of the soil. Those properties are considered to be stable respectively long-term properties of a soil, when looked at it with the interest of modelling the transport processes of Phosphate in soils. Factors such as water-content, temperature, vegetation and precipitation are factors that temporally can vary fast and to a certain degree unpredictably. Organic forms of phosphates, prominently DNA or oligonucleotides and phytate are also subject to physicochemical reactions, mainly decomposition, but are foremost controlled in their presence by enzymatic processes, where i.e. plants form phytates in seeds to provide the embryo a compact and specific reserve of phosphate, but many bacteria possess via Phytases the ability to hydrolyse phytate and use it for their own means. To assess and cover those phenomena, models, dynamically describing the motion of Phosphorous in soils, differentiate several pools of Phosphorous, most prominently the organic-P, dissolved-P, adsorbed-P, mineral-P, where the difference in temporal behaviour, such as the mean-reside-time invite a differentiation between labile-P, semi-labile-P and so on.

## Principle Mechanism of P-transport to the Plant

Plants that live in ground, interface with their roots the soil-matrix, soil-solution and air-pockets. It is the interface between root and soil-solution, where the exchange, particularly the uptake of water and nutrients happens. High-affinity phosphate transporters are mainly responsible for the transport of phosphate from the soil-solution into the cytosol. The momentary concentration of orthophosphate [$H_nPO_4^{n-3}$] in the soil-solution is called the intensity. It is influenced by sinks such as biological uptake, precipitation, adsorption and leaching, sources are dissolution of phosphate-minerals, mineralization resp. enzymatic hydrolization of organic Phosphate-esters and -anhydrides. Since it is difficult and sometimes up to now impossible to accurately assess all these factors, it has been shown beneficial to use a more agnostic approach and regard the net-diffusion rates, as a black-box model. For the sake of simplicity and feasibility, all biological-uptake can be removed, such that only the interaction between soil-matrix and soil-solution can be observed. Such a model would consist of the soil-matrix, containing the adsorption-surfaces and the interfacing soil-solution that exchanges phosphates until an equilibrium is reached. There have been different approaches to capture the diffusion of Phosphate. The IEK method employs $^{31}P$ and assesses the amount of P, that is exchangeable between both phases and the temporal development of that amount. Flossmann & Richter assessed the net-diffusion rate and equilibrium-concentration, modelling the diffusion-process as a first-order-kinetic. Whilst IEK observes the diffusion in a steady-state, the approach of Flossmann & Richter did start with a system of dried fine soil and deionized water, and subsequently sampling at different time-points, observing the desorption-reaction-speed from start to equilibrium. 

## Prediction of biological sinks

The prediction of biological sinks, particularly plant uptake is of great practical and academic interest. To adequately estimate the ability of a soil to provide sufficient $Pi$ by assessing the status of both soil and soil-solution is the basis for economically and ecologically sustainable fertilization practice. Several approaches and models exist and aim to connect estimations of the $Pi$-availability and the expected requirements of crops. The predominant of models in use try to measure the extractable $Pi$ via different solvents, and depending on agressivity of the solvent to identify different pools of $Pi$. The extraction of $Pi$ with $H_2O$ or weakly acidic aqueous solutions are generally identified as the immediately available $Pi$ or the Intensity. Extractants with strong acids or chelators, able to dissolve and desorb strongly bound $Pi$ are identified as the $Pi$-Pool that will eventually become available to plants and is often called the Capacity. Such models continue to calculate the required amount of $Pi$ by starting with the expexted uptake of the planned crop, this uptake is often
