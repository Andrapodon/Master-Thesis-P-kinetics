	abstract = {Stoichiometric approaches have been applied to understand the relationship between soil organic matter dynamics and biological nutrient transformations. However, very few studies have explicitly considered the effects of agricultural management practices on the soil C : N : P ratio. The aim of this study was to assess how different input types and rates would affect the C : N : P molar ratios of bulk soil, organic matter and microbial biomass in cropped soils in the long term. Thus, we analysed the C, N, and P inputs and budgets as well as soil properties in three long-term experiments established on different soil types: the Saria soil fertility trial (Burkina Faso), the Wagga Wagga rotation/stubble management/soil preparation trial (Australia), and the {DOK} (bio-Dynamic, bio-Organic, and “Konventionell”) cropping system trial (Switzerland). In each of these trials, there was a large range of C, N, and P inputs which had a strong impact on element concentrations in soils. However, although C : N : P ratios of the inputs were highly variable, they had only weak effects on soil C : N : P ratios. At Saria, a positive correlation was found between the N : P ratio of inputs and microbial biomass, while no relation was observed between the nutrient ratios of inputs and soil organic matter. At Wagga Wagga, the C : P ratio of inputs was signiﬁcantly correlated to total soil C : P, N : P, and C : N ratios, but had no impact on the elemental composition of microbial biomass. In the {DOK} trial, a positive correlation was found between the C budget and the C to organic P ratio in soils, while the nutrient ratios of inputs were not related to those in the microbial biomass. We argue that these responses are due to differences in soil properties among sites. At Saria, the soil is dominated by quartz and some kaolinite, has a coarse texture, a fragile structure, and a low nutrient content. Thus, microorganisms feed on inputs (plant residues, manure). In contrast, the soil at Wagga Wagga contains illite and haematite, is richer in clay and nutrients, and has a stable structure. Thus, organic matter is protected from mineralization and can therefore accumulate, allowing microorganisms to feed on soil nutrients and to keep a constant C : N : P ratio. The {DOK} soil represents an intermediate situation, with high nutrient concentrations, but a rather fragile soil structure, where organic matter does not accumulate. We conclude that the study of C, N, and P ratios is important to understand the functioning of cropped soils in the long term, but that it must be coupled with a precise assessment of element inputs and budgets in the system and a good understanding of the ability of soils to stabilize C, N, and P compounds.},

The data suggest that generally, the total soil trace metal content, and trace metal concentrations determined by complexing agents (such as the widely used {DTPA} and {EDTA} extractants) or acid extractants (such as 0.1 M {HCl} and the Mehlich 1 extractant) are only poorly correlated to plant phytoavailability. Whilst there is no consensus, it would appear that neutral salt extractants (such as 0.01 M {CaCl}2 and 0.1 M {NaNO}3) provide the most useful indication of metal phytoavailability across a range of metals of interest, although further research is required.},

Results 32P-labeled inositol phosphates were separated by anion exchange {HPLC} with phosphate eluents. Additional {HPLC} methods were developed to allow facile separation of myo-, neo-, 1D-chiro- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate on acid gradients.

Additionally, we describe {HPLC} separations of all inositol hexakisphosphates yet identified in soils, using a collection of soil inositol phosphates described in the seminal historic studies of Cosgrove, Tate and coworkers.

It is based on two sequential discussion rounds with all participants. Important progress was reported regarding the awareness of P as ﬁnite mineable resource, technologies to recycle P, and legislation towards a circular P economy. Yet, critical deﬁcits were identiﬁed such as how to handle legacy P, how climate change may affect ecosystem P cycling, or working business models to up-scale existing recycling models. Workshop participants argued for more transdisciplinary networks to narrow a perceived sciencepractice/policy gap.

	abstract = {The exchange rate of inorganic phosphorus (P) between the soil solution and solid phase, also known as soil solution P turnover, is essential for describing the kinetics of bioavailable P. While soil solution P turnover (Km) can be determined by tracing radioisotopes in a soil–solution system, few studies have done so. We believe that this is due to a lack of understanding on how to derive Km from isotopic exchange kinetic ({IEK}) experiments, a common form of radioisotope dilution study. Here, we provide a derivation of calculating Km using parameters obtained from {IEK} experiments. We then calculated Km for 217 soils from published {IEK} experiments in terrestrial ecosystems, and also that of 18 long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments. Analysis of the global compilation data set revealed a negative relationship between concentrations of soil solution P and Km. Furthermore, Km buffered isotopically exchangeable P in soils with low concentrations of soil solution P. This ﬁnding was supported by an analysis of long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments, which revealed a negative relationship between Km and phosphate-buffering capacity. Our study highlights the importance of calculating Km for understanding the kinetics of P between the soil solid and solution phases where it is bioavailable. We argue that our derivation can also be used to calculate soil solution turnover of other environmentally relevant and strongly sorbing elements that can be traced with radioisotopes, such as zinc, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and uranium.},

The E and L values of the surface horizons of 10 soils from tropical, mediterranean, and temperate regions were determined. The L value was measured from a 13-wk pot experiment with common bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) where the available soil P was labeled with 32PO4 ions in the presence of a carrier (25-50 mg "P kg {\textasciitilde}' soil). To determine the £ value, the isotopic exchange kinetic experiment was carried out on each soil. Carrier-free 32PO4 was added to the soil-solution system at a steady state and the quantity of isotopically exchangeable soil phosphate at time t, E(f), was calculated from the kinetic equation describing the decrease of radioactivity in solution with time. Results showed that L values determined after 13 wk were not significantly different from E(t) values extrapolated to the same period ({\textless} = 131040 min). It was concluded that (i) the L value is a particular point of the kinetic equation and (ii) isotopically exchangeable phosphate is the available P for common bentgrass. A strict equality between £(13wk) and L values was not, however, reached for all samples. Possible causes for the differences were: (i) an overestimation of the water-soluble phosphate due to the presence of silica and (ii) disturbance of the steady state following a too large uptake of phosphate by the crop or the application of too large quantities of carrier compared with the initial quantity of exchangeable soil phosphate.},

The ash was thermochemically treated in a lab-scale rotary furnace after mixing it with a chlorine-donor, either {CaCl}2 or {MgCl}2. Within each of these two sample series only a single process parameter, the reaction temperature, was varied, namely between 350 and 1050°C. It was found, that among the numerous crystalline phases present in the raw ash only quartz and hematite continue to exist after thermochemical treatments carried out at 1050°C, whereas all other components undergo at least one decomposition–recrystallization cycle. Some of the components re-crystallize even several times. It was proved that the restructuring of the calcium- and phosphorus-bearing mineral phases proceeds via the formation of chlorspodioside, Ca2PO4Cl. The influence of the type of chlorine-donor on the final product was elucidated in detail and - to the best of our knowledge - for the first time crystalline {AlPO}4 was found in a sewage sludge ash and its decomposition was investigated, too.},

	abstract = {Thermochemical treatments allow production of sewage sludge ash ({SSA}) rich in P and low in heavy metals, which could be recycled in agriculture. Our objective was to quantify P release from {SSA} using ion sink assays and to relate these results to P speciation in {SSA} and plant P uptake. Anion and cation exchange membranes saturated with different counterions ({HCO}3, Na, and H) were used to create a gradient in {pH}, P, or cation concentration between {SSA} particles and the surrounding solution. Phosphorus speciation in {SSA} was assessed using X-ray powder diffraction, and plant P uptake was determined in a pot experiment with an acidic and a neutral soil. Four {SSA} products were investigated: a {SSA} thermochemically treated with {CaCl}2 or {MgCl}2 ({SSA} Ca/Mg), a {SSA} blended with {KCl}, and a {SSA} blended with {KCl} and triple superphosphate ({TSP}) to obtain a marketable 12–20 P–K fertilizer. The H membranes dissolved all P species present in {SSA}. Combined {HCO}3/Na membranes extracted diffusible P and noncrystalline P from {SSA} Ca/Mg and stanfieldite from {SSA} Mg. Blending with {KCl} hardly changed P release from {SSA}, whereas blending with {TSP} masked P release. The amount of P extracted from {SSA} by combined {HCO}3/Na membranes was correlated to plant P use in the acid soil, whereas the amount of P extracted by {HCO}3 membranes alone was correlated to P use in the neutral soil. In conclusion, the ion sink assays delivered information on P release that was related to both {SSA} mineralogy and P use by plants.},

Reference treatments with water-soluble P added at equal amounts of total P were included. The transfer of P from {SSACa} and {SSAMg} to Lolium multiflorum or P pools of sequentially extracted soil-fertilizer incubations were quantified.
Results The shoot P uptake from {SSAMg} was higher than from {SSACa}. For {SSAMg} the relative effectiveness compared to a water-soluble P fertilizer was 88 \% on an acidic and 71 \% on a neutral soil but only 4 \% on an alkaline soil. The proportion of P derived from the fertilizer in the plant and in the first two extraction pools of soil-fertilizer incubations were strongly correlated, suggesting that it is sufficient to conduct an incubation study to obtain robust information on plant P availability.
Conclusions We conclude that under acidic to neutral conditions {SSAMg} presents an appropriate alternative to conventional P fertilizers and the dissolution of P from {SSAMg} seems to be governed by protons and cations in the soil solution.},

This near-binary distribution of spectroscopic properties was also found in {AFM}-measured particle sizes and Ca/P molar ratios by elemental analysis.

In practice, however, plant-available P is assessed by chemical extractions solubilizing a mixture of P forms the availability of which is ill defined. We undertook an isotopic approach to assess the exchangeability of P extracted by (1) {CO}2-saturated water (P-{CO}2), (2) ammonium acetate {EDTA} (P-{AAEDTA}), and (3) sodium bicarbonate ({PNaHCO}3) compared to the exchangeability of P extracted by water. Five topsoils with similar P-fertilization histories but different soil properties were studied. Phosphorus was extracted from soils labeled with carrier-free 33P after 1 week of incubation, and the specific activity ({SA} = 33P / 31P) of the extracts was compared with the {SA} of P extracted by water to calculate the amount of P isotopically exchangeable that had been solubilized during the extraction. P-{CO}2 extracted between 20 and 100 times less P than P-{AAEDTA} and {PNaHCO}3. The {SA} of P-{CO}2 was not different from the {SA} of water-extractable P, showing that P-{CO}2 solubilized similar forms of P as water and that these forms can be considered as available. The {SA} of P extracted by the two other methods ranged between 25\% and 63\% for P-{AAEDTA} and 66\% and 92\% for P-{NaHCO}3 of the {SA} of water-extractable P. The fraction of exchangeable P extracted by {AAEDTA} decreased linearly with increasing soil {pH}, suggesting that this method dissolves slowly or non-exchangeable P from calcium phosphates.},

	abstract = {Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is the main source of P for most crops. The amount of P that is located on the solid phase of a soil and that can exchange with P in the soil solution can be calculated knowing the concentration of water-extractable P ({CP}) and two kinetic parameters: (i) the ratio between the total introduced radioactivity added as 33P in a soil/water system and the radioactivity remaining after 1 min in this solution (R/r1minute) and (ii) the rate of disappearance of 33P from the solution with time (n). The aim of this article was to propose statistical models describing R/r1minute and n as a function of {CP} and other soil properties. By doing so we made the hypothesis that it is possible, knowing {CP} and selected soil properties, to calculate the amount of P located on the solid phase of the soil that remains isotopically exchangeable after 1 min and 60 min (Pr1minute, Pr60minutes). This work was done in two steps. First, isotopic exchange kinetic experiments were carried on nine soil samples (set A) sampled in 1998 that had been incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of water-soluble P. Results from these experiments allowed development of models to calculate R/r1minute as a function of {CP}, soil {pH}, and dithionite-extractable Fe (Fed) and n as a function of {CP}. In the second step, we compared R/r1minute, n, Pr1minute, and Pr60minutes values obtained from the isotopic exchange kinetic experiments conducted on an independent set of 27 soil samples (set B) to the values computed from our statistical models. Modeled and experimental values were highly signiﬁcantly correlated to each other, showing that the three parameters {CP}, soil {pH}, and Fed explained more than 75\% of the variability of the experimental results. Experimental and modelled values of R/r1minute and Pr1minute were not different from each other, whereas experimental values of n and Pr60minutes were statistically signiﬁcantly different from the modeled values. Finally, the limits and applicability of our approach for the development of a pedotransfer function to predict Pr are discussed.},

              Many European cropped soils have high soil test P ({STP}) values in the top soil because of P accumulation over many years of fertilizer application. This should allow to save P fertilizer applications for some years without {STP} values decreasing to a level that might negatively impact crop yield. However, the way {STP} develops under omitted P fertilizer application is not well understood. We examined {STP} development under omitted P fertilizer application for timeframes between 7 and 46 years on 96 unfertilized treatments (P0 treatments) of 43 European long‐term P field experiments, using five different {STP} methods. For comparability, values obtained by different {STP} methods were converted to Olsen‐P concentrations. We fitted exponential decay curves to Olsen‐P data of each P0 treatment defined by initial Olsen‐P values (
              Olsen‐P
              
                i

              ) and asymptotes (
              A
              ), reflecting minimum obtainable {STP}. Subsequently, we analysed whether the variables most commonly recorded in experiments, are sufficient to explain the variation in model parameters, these variables being P export, clay content, C
              org
              and {pH} as well as average annual temperature and precipitation. We found that out of our predictor variables, soil clay content, precipitation and temperature were showing the most prominent effects on the parameters

              . However, the amount of variation explained by the considered variables was too low to potentially facilitate a prediction of {STP} decrease, and various P0 treatments showed no clear Olsen‐P decrease or unexpectedly high asymptotes. This hints at a strong influence of the P sorption capacity of the soil with often high potential for replenishment from less available P pools. In connection with P introduction from the subsoil or possibly from surrounding plots, the extension of timeframes of omitted P fertilizer application without reaching critical {STP} values for crop production, might be explainable. Corresponding effects could not be analysed because of lack of data for most P0 treatments, calling for the additional determination of, for example, the maximum P sorption capacity, total P and subsoil P in future experiments.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to modify the Mehlich 2 (M2) extractant to include Cu among the extractable nutrients, retain or enhance the wide range of soils for which it is suitable and minimize it's corrosive properties. The substitution of nitrate for chloride anions and the addition of {EDTA} accomplished those objectives. The new extracting solution, already designated Mehlich 3 (M3) is composed of 0.2N {CH}3COOH - 0.25N {NH}4N03 - 0.015NNH4F - 0.013NHN03 - 0.001M {EDTA}. Extractions from 105 soils using M3, M2, Bray 1 (Bl) and Ammonium Acetate ({AA}) were compared to evaluate the new extractant. The quantity of F extracted by M3 exceeded that by M2 20\% and that by Bl 4\% but the results from all extractions were highly correlated. Extractions of both K and Mg by M3 were 6-8\% higher than those by {AA} and 3-4\% higher than those by M2, but, again, there was high correlation among methods. Addition of {EDTA} increased Cu extractions by 170\%, Mn by 50\% and Zn by 25\%. Cu extractions by M3 correlated with those from the Mehlich-Bowling method. High correlations between Mn, as well as Zn, extracted by M3 and M2 were shown.},

The response of Setaria to the P treatments was clearly indicated by the {DM} yield and for each soil {TSP} was superior to either {CIPR} or {GPR}. The {RAE} of {GPR} (90\%) was higher than that of {CIPR} (72\%).

	abstract = {Several chemical and physical properties of 10 phosphate rock ({PR}) materials of varying reactivity were evaluated. These included North Carolina phosphate rock ({NCPR}), Sechura phosphate rock ({SPR}), Chatham Rise phosphorite ({CRP}), Arad phosphate rock ({APR}), Gafsa phosphate rock ({GPR}), North Florida phosphate rock ({NFPR}), Jordanian phosphate rock ({JPR}), Mexican phosphate rock ({MPR}), Nauru Island phosphate rock ({NIPR}), and Makatea Island phosphate rock ({MIPR}). Concentrations of As and Cd were highest in {NCPR} and U was higher in {APR} and {CRP} than in the other reactive {PR} materials. Because Cd and U can accumulate in biological systems, it may be necessary to direct more attention towards the likely implications of Cd and U concentrations when evaluating a {PR} for direct application. Three sequential extractions with 2\% citric acid may be more useful for comparing the chemical solubility of {PR} materials, particularly for those containing appreciable {CaCO}3. For each particle-size fraction from {\textless}63 to {\textgreater}500 μm, {SPR} was more soluble in 2\% citric acid than was {NCPR}. The higher solubility of {SPR} than {NCPR} in 2\% citric acid, 2\% formic acid, and neutral ammonium citrate possibly results from a higher chemical reactivity rather than from any difference in the surface area presented for dissolution. The poor relationship obtained between surface area and the solubility of the {PR} materials in the three chemical extractants suggests that surface area plays a secondary role to chemical reactivity in controlling the solubility of a {PR} in a chemical extractant. A Promesh plot provided an effective method for describing the particle-size characteristics of those {PR} materials which occurred as sands. Fundamental characteristics, such as mean particle size and uniformity, can readily be determined from a Promesh plot.},

	abstract = {Dissolution of phosphate rock ({PR}) in contrasting soils was evaluated by extraction with 0.5 M {NaOH} following a prewash with 1 M {NaCl} to remove exchangeable Ca2+. This provides a simple and direct method for measuring the rate and extent of {PR} dissolution in soils. Dissolution of Sechura phosphate rock ({SPR}) in six soils was essentially complete at 90 d and the pattern of dissolution could be described by a modified Mitscherlich equation of the form y = A (1 − e-ex), in which y = amount of {SPR} dissolved at time x; A = asymptote, and c = curvature coefficient. Whereas A varied markedly across soils, c was independent of soil type. This exponential equation formed the basis of a simple model which describes and predicts the dissolution of {SPR} in soils. By establishing the relationship between A and a range of properties for 30 contrasting soils it was possible to identify those soil parameters that controlled {PR} dissolution in soil. Percent Ca-saturation, P-sorption capacity, and Ca-exchange capacity of the soil were the three most important parameters influencing {SPR} dissolution in soils. When a model incorporating these three parameters was tested on soils not used to construct the model, the variance accounted for ranged from 66 to 76\%, depending on the population of soils selected. These parameters determine the concentrations of Ca2+ and H2PO-4 in the soil solution.},

	abstract = {Two surface soils (Patua and Tokomaru) of contrasting mineralogy were incubated with several levels of either {CaCO}3 or {HC}1. The effects of ionic strength on {pH}, on surface charge, and on the adsorption of phosphate and sulphate were measured in three concentrations of {NaCl}. The {pH} at which the net surface charge was zero (point of net zero charge—{PZC}) was 1.8 for the Tokomaru soil and 4.6 for the Patua soil: differences that can be related to mineralogical composition. There was an analogous point of zero salt effect ({PZSE}) that occurred at {pH} 2.8 for the Tokomaru soil and at 4.6 for the Patua soil. The presence of permanent negative charge in the Tokomaru soil resulted in an increase in {PZSE} over {PZC}. The effect of ionic strength on adsorption varied greatly between phosphate and sulphate. For phosphate, there was a characteristic {pH} above which increasing ionic strength increased adsorption and below which the reverse occurred. This {pH} ({PZSE} for adsorption) was higher than the {PZC} of the soil and was 4.1 for the Tokomaru soil and 5.3 for the Patua soil. In contrast, increasing ionic strength always decreased sulphate adsorption and the adsorption curves obtained in solutions of different ionic strengths converged above {pH} 7.0. If increasing ionic strength decreases adsorption, the potential in the plane of adsorption must be positive. Also, if increasing ionic strength increases adsorption, the potential must be negative. This suggests that, depending upon {pH}, phosphate is adsorbed when the potential in the plane of adsorption is either positive or negative, whereas sulphate is absorbed only when the potential is positive.},

We assessed gross Po mineralization and immobilization using labeling with 33P in four calcareous Alﬁsols with varying concentrations of Olsen soil test P that were collected from forage ﬁelds of dairy farms in Ontario, Canada. Rapid microbial 33P uptake during incubation was found for the soils with the lowest available Pi as indicated by both Olsen soil test P and water-extractable Pi. The tracer incorporation into microbial P after 8 days ranged from 7 to 44\% of applied 33P and was negatively related to water-extractable Pi following a power-type relationship. As concentrations of microbial P were similar in all soils, this suggests faster turnover of P in the microbial biomass at water-extractable Pi below 0.1 mg P {kgÀ}1 soil. Daily gross Po mineralization rates ranged from 0.2 to 2.8 mg P {kgÀ}1 soil {dÀ}1 and contributed 7e56\% of the isotopically-exchangeable P in 8 days.

Adsorption isotherms were built and electrophoretic and {pH} measurements were carried out in order to determine the nature of the adsorbent-adsorbate bonds. The quantity of adsorbed compound reached 5.41 umol Pi m{\textasciitilde}2, 5.06 umol G1P m'1, and 1.37 umol I6P m{\textasciitilde}2. The G1P and I6P were adsorbed on the surface hydroxyls of goethite through their phosphate groups. The proposed adsorption mechanism, notwithstanding the nature of the organic moiety, is a specific adsorption by a ligand exchange between the phosphate groups and the surface reactive hydroxyls. Inner-sphere surface complexes are formed between phosphate groups and Fe. Very little dissolution of the goethite occurred during the adsorption of either of the two ligands ({GIF} and I6P). Tentative configurations of the formed organophosphate-goetbite complexes are proposed.},

However, the majority of organic P in soil remains ‘unresolved’ and is largely observed as a ‘broad’ signal within the phosphomonoester region of a solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectrum on soil extracts. Our aim was to gain insight into the composition of four soils using the transverse relaxation (T2) time of the magnetisation in solution 31P {NMR} spectroscopy as a probe of their structure. We found the broad signal within the phosphomonoester region rapidly decayed compared to the sharp signals (i.e. myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate) across all soils, which corresponded to the former having a shorter T2 time than the latter, and supports the existence of a broad signal due to supra-/macro-molecular structures. Furthermore, measures of the broad signal's line-width at half peak intensity based on T2 times were found to be less than that obtained from spectral deconvolution ﬁtting. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the broad signal is itself comprised of more than one component. The signiﬁcance of this is that the chemical nature of a large proportion of soil organic P appears to be structurally complex.},

Four stereoisomers of inositol hexakisphosphate ({IP}6) occur, although for three of these (scyllo, neo, and D-chiro) the origins, dynamics, and biological function remain unknown, due in large part to analytical limitations in their measurement in environmental samples. We synthesized authentic neo- and D-chiro-{IP}6 and used them to identify signals from these compounds in three soils from the Falkland Islands. Both compounds resisted hypobromite oxidation and gave quantiﬁable 31P {NMR} signals at δ = 6.67 ppm (equatorial phosphate groups of the 4equatorial/2-axial conformer of neo-{IP}6) and δ = 6.48 ppm (equatorial phosphate groups of the 2-equatorial/4-axial conformer of D-chiro-{IP}6) in soil extracts. Inositol hexakisphosphate accounted for 46−54\% of the soil organic phosphorus, of which the four stereoisomers constituted, on average, 55.9\% (myo), 32.8\% (scyllo), 6.1\% (neo), and 5.2\% (D-chiro). Reappraisal of the literature based on the new signal assignments revealed that neo- and D-chiro-{IP}6 occur widely in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These results conﬁrm that the inositol phosphates can constitute a considerable fraction of the organic phosphorus in soils and reveal the prevalence of neo- and D-chiro-{IP}6 in the environment. The hypobromite oxidation and solution 31P {NMR} spectroscopy procedure allows the simultaneous quantiﬁcation of all four {IP}6 stereoisomers in environmental samples and provides a platform for research into the origins and ecological signiﬁcance of these enigmatic compounds.},

	abstract = {Lake sediments are known to be a significant source of phosphorus (P) to plankton populations under certain biogeochemical conditions; however, the contribution of sediment organic P (Porg) to internal P loads remains poorly understood. We investigated Porg speciation and bioavailability in sediments collected over multiple months from a shallow, eutrophic bay in Lake Champlain (Missisquoi Bay,{VT}) using solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy and enzymatic hydrolysis ({EH}) analysis of sediments collected during years with (2008) and without (2007) algal blooms. Sediments collected during bloom onset (July) and peak bloom (August) months contained the largest proportion of enzyme-labile P, whereas pre- and postbloom sediments were primarily composed of nonlabile P. Monoester P to diester P ratios changed with respect to depth, particularly during bloom periods. Monoester P and {DNA} accumulation, likely from settling particulate matter, began at the onset of the bloom and continued into October 2008 during the postbloom period. The disappearance of inositol hexakisphosphate stereoisomers and the generation of orthophosphate at lower sediment depths was also evident in August 2008. Principal components analysis of {EH} and {NMR} species proportions confirmed differences between sediment cores collected during bloom onset and peak bloom, compared with pre- and postbloom sediments. Large enzymelabile and Porg species proportions corresponded to increased sediment P flux and reduced manganese and iron species in porewater. These findings suggest that interseasonal changes in Porg speciation may influence P mobility in sediments and contribute to important feedback dynamics between biological productivity and sediment water interface geochemistry.},

Qualitative and preparative paper chromatography, mass spectrometry, infrared ({IR}) and nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy were the principal methods used to identify the stereochemistry of the inositol moieties. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy proved to be the most useful means of differentiating among the soil and plant inositol phosphates.

The presence of D-chiro-inositol phosphate but absence of muco-inositol phosphate in the desert soil poses questions concerning the fate of the latter in the soil.

Despite the prevalence of inositol phosphates in the environment, their cycling, mobility and bioavailability are poorly understood. This is largely related to analytical difficulties associated with the extraction, separation and detection of inositol phosphates in environmental samples. This review summarizes the current knowledge of inositol phosphates in the environment and the analytical techniques currently available for their detection in environmental samples. Recent advances in technology, such as the development of suitable chromatographic and capillary electrophoresis separation techniques, should help to elucidate some of the more pertinent questions regarding inositol phosphates in the natural environment.},

	abstract = {The isotopic exchange kinetic ({IEK}) method allows assessing the rate of orthophosphate ions (Pi) exchange between the solid phase and the solution of the soil with time. However, two challenges have to be tackled when using this technique in soils with a very low water extractable Pi concentration ({CP}) and with a high sorbing capacity for Pi. The ﬁrst is that current colorimetric methods do not allow quantifying Pi concentrations lower than 10 μg P L−1. While the second challenge is that a signiﬁcant fractionation between P isotopes may occur in the soil solution system in the presence of soils with high Pi sorption capacity. We assessed here: i) whether concentrating the blue phosphomolybdate complex ({BPMC}) in hexanol prior to its measurement would allow to lower the detection and quantiﬁcation limits of Pi, ii) whether a signiﬁcant isotopic fractionation between 32Pi and 33Pi could occur during {IEK} experiments conducted in the presence of high Pi sorbing substrates (e.g., pure goethite or Malagasy soils) and iii) whether the {IEK} method when used in conjunction with the hexanol concentration of the {BPMC} to measure {CP} would detect changes in Pi isotopic exchangeability in a ferralsol cropped with upland rice following the input of manure or water soluble fertilizer. The detection and quantiﬁcation limits of the {BPMC} concentrated by hexanol were 0.3 and 0.8 μg P L−1, respectively, using a cell of 10 cm length for the colorimetric measurement. The {IEK} conducted on Pi amended goethite and on Malagasy soils with 32Pi and 33Pi did not show any systematic isotopic fractionation between both isotopes, suggesting that in these soils 31Pi and 32Pi or 33Pi have a similar behavior during isotopic exchange. The analysis of the soils sampled in the ﬁeld experiment showed a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of Pi isotopically exchangeable after 1 min only after the application of water soluble P. This increase was paralleled by increases in rice yield and P export by grains demonstrating an increased P availability in this treatment. In conclusion, the {IEK} method can be used in low P and high Pi sorbing soils as the hexanol concentration method allows measuring very low {CP} and as the different P isotopes have a similar behavior in the soil/solution system. The {IEK} experiments conducted in the presence of goethite, however, point out to the necessity of taking into account the dispersion of particles for a proper interpretation of the isotopic data.},

Raman and 31P {NMR} spectral parameters were investigated in a series of synthetic B-type carbonated apatites ({CAps}). Inverse 31P {NMR} linewidth and inverse Raman {PO}43À ν1 bandwidth were both correlated with powder {XRD} c-axis crystallinity over the 0.3–10.3 wt\% {CO}32À range investigated. Comparison with bone powder crystallinities showed agreement with values predicted by {NMR} and Raman calibration curves. Carbonate content was divided into two domains by the 31P {NMR} chemical shift frequency and the Raman phosphate ν1 band position. These parameters remain stable except for an abrupt transition at 6.5 wt\% carbonate, a composition which corresponds to an average of one carbonate per unit cell. This near-binary distribution of spectroscopic properties was also found in {AFM}-measured particle sizes and Ca/P molar ratios by elemental analysis. We propose that this transition differentiates between two charge-balancing ion-loss mechanisms as measured by Ca/P ratios. These results deﬁne a criterion for spectroscopic characterization of B-type carbonate substitution in apatitic minerals.},

Reference treatments with water-soluble P added at equal amounts of total P were included. The transfer of P from {SSACa} and {SSAMg} to Lolium multiflorum or P pools of sequentially extracted soil-fertilizer incubations were quantified.
Results The shoot P uptake from {SSAMg} was higher than from {SSACa}. For {SSAMg} the relative effectiveness compared to a water-soluble P fertilizer was 88 \% on an acidic and 71 \% on a neutral soil but only 4 \% on an alkaline soil. The proportion of P derived from the fertilizer in the plant and in the first two extraction pools of soil-fertilizer incubations were strongly correlated, suggesting that it is sufficient to conduct an incubation study to obtain robust information on plant P availability.
Conclusions We conclude that under acidic to neutral conditions {SSAMg} presents an appropriate alternative to conventional P fertilizers and the dissolution of P from {SSAMg} seems to be governed by protons and cations in the soil solution.},

Our objective was to quantify P release from {SSA} using ion sink assays and to relate these results to P speciation in {SSA} and plant P uptake. Anion and cation exchange membranes saturated with different counterions ({HCO}3, Na, and H) were used to create a gradient in {pH}, P, or cation concentration between {SSA} particles and the surrounding solution. Phosphorus speciation in {SSA} was assessed using X-ray powder diffraction, and plant P uptake was determined in a pot experiment with an acidic and a neutral soil. Four {SSA} products were investigated: a {SSA} thermochemically treated with {CaCl}2 or {MgCl}2 ({SSA} Ca/Mg), a {SSA} blended with {KCl}, and a {SSA} blended with {KCl} and triple superphosphate ({TSP}) to obtain a marketable 12–20 P–K fertilizer. The H membranes dissolved all P species present in {SSA}. Combined {HCO}3/Na membranes extracted diffusible P and noncrystalline P from {SSA} Ca/Mg and stanfieldite from {SSA} Mg. Blending with {KCl} hardly changed P release from {SSA}, whereas blending with {TSP} masked P release. The amount of P extracted from {SSA} by combined {HCO}3/Na membranes was correlated to plant P use in the acid soil, whereas the amount of P extracted by {HCO}3 membranes alone was correlated to P use in the neutral soil. In conclusion, the ion sink assays delivered information on P release that was related to both {SSA} mineralogy and P use by plants.},

The ash was thermochemically treated in a lab-scale rotary furnace after mixing it with a chlorine-donor, either {CaCl}2 or {MgCl}2. Within each of these two sample series only a single process parameter, the reaction temperature, was varied, namely between 350 and 1050°C. It was found, that among the numerous crystalline phases present in the raw ash only quartz and hematite continue to exist after thermochemical treatments carried out at 1050°C, whereas all other components undergo at least one decomposition–recrystallization cycle. Some of the components re-crystallize even several times. It was proved that the restructuring of the calcium- and phosphorus-bearing mineral phases proceeds via the formation of chlorspodioside, Ca2PO4Cl. The influence of the type of chlorine-donor on the final product was elucidated in detail and - to the best of our knowledge - for the first time crystalline {AlPO}4 was found in a sewage sludge ash and its decomposition was investigated, too.},

The E and L values of the surface horizons of 10 soils from tropical, mediterranean, and temperate regions were determined. The L value was measured from a 13-wk pot experiment with common bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) where the available soil P was labeled with 32PO4 ions in the presence of a carrier (25-50 mg "P kg {\textasciitilde}' soil). To determine the £ value, the isotopic exchange kinetic experiment was carried out on each soil. Carrier-free 32PO4 was added to the soil-solution system at a steady state and the quantity of isotopically exchangeable soil phosphate at time t, E(f), was calculated from the kinetic equation describing the decrease of radioactivity in solution with time. Results showed that L values determined after 13 wk were not significantly different from E(t) values extrapolated to the same period ({\textless} = 131040 min). It was concluded that (i) the L value is a particular point of the kinetic equation and (ii) isotopically exchangeable phosphate is the available P for common bentgrass. A strict equality between £(13wk) and L values was not, however, reached for all samples. Possible causes for the differences were: (i) an overestimation of the water-soluble phosphate due to the presence of silica and (ii) disturbance of the steady state following a too large uptake of phosphate by the crop or the application of too large quantities of carrier compared with the initial quantity of exchangeable soil phosphate.},

While soil solution P turnover (Km) can be determined by tracing radioisotopes in a soil–solution system, few studies have done so. We believe that this is due to a lack of understanding on how to derive Km from isotopic exchange kinetic ({IEK}) experiments, a common form of radioisotope dilution study. Here, we provide a derivation of calculating Km using parameters obtained from {IEK} experiments. We then calculated Km for 217 soils from published {IEK} experiments in terrestrial ecosystems, and also that of 18 long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments. Analysis of the global compilation data set revealed a negative relationship between concentrations of soil solution P and Km. Furthermore, Km buffered isotopically exchangeable P in soils with low concentrations of soil solution P. This ﬁnding was supported by an analysis of long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments, which revealed a negative relationship between Km and phosphate-buffering capacity. Our study highlights the importance of calculating Km for understanding the kinetics of P between the soil solid and solution phases where it is bioavailable. We argue that our derivation can also be used to calculate soil solution turnover of other environmentally relevant and strongly sorbing elements that can be traced with radioisotopes, such as zinc, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and uranium.},

	abstract = {Methods We employed the enzyme inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, {IP}5 2-K, to transfer phosphate from [γ-32P]{ATP} to axial hydroxyl(s) of myo-, neo- and 1D-chiro-inositol phosphate substrates.
Results 32P-labeled inositol phosphates were separated by anion exchange {HPLC} with phosphate eluents. Additional {HPLC} methods were developed to allow facile separation of myo-, neo-, 1D-chiro- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate on acid gradients.
Conclusions We developed enzymic approaches that allow the synthesis of labeled myo-inositol 1,[32P]2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate; neo-inositol 1,[32P]2,3,4,[32P]5,6–hexakisphosphate and 1D-chiroinositol [32P]1,2,3,4,5,[32P]6-hexakisphosphate. Additionally, we describe {HPLC} separations of all inositol hexakisphosphates yet identified in soils, using a collection of soil inositol phosphates described in the seminal historic studies of Cosgrove, Tate and coworkers. Our study will enable others to perform radiotracer experiments to analyze fluxes of phosphate to/from inositol hexakisphosphates in different soils.},

A large data set was taken from the literature, and the effectiveness of various extractants to predict the phytoavailability of Cd, Zn, Ni, Cu, and Pb examined across a range of soil types and contamination levels. The data suggest that generally, the total soil trace metal content, and trace metal concentrations determined by complexing agents (such as the widely used {DTPA} and {EDTA} extractants) or acid extractants (such as 0.1 M {HCl} and the Mehlich 1 extractant) are only poorly correlated to plant phytoavailability. Whilst there is no consensus, it would appear that neutral salt extractants (such as 0.01 M {CaCl}2 and 0.1 M {NaNO}3) provide the most useful indication of metal phytoavailability across a range of metals of interest, although further research is required.},

	abstract = {Bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) in the agricultural soil constitutes a dangerous risk for the health of both the environment and humans. Especially in the European Union, a large amount of Cd in agricultural topsoil originates from mineral fertilizer application. In this context, the {EU} has recently adopted the Regulation ({EU}) 2019/1009 with the aim to establish stricter limits for Cd presence in fertilizer products and to promote a higher use of fertilizers from organic sources. This paper discusses the future implications of the new regulation to limit the presence of cadmium (Cd) in agricultural soils and food products. The Regulation ({EU}) 2019/1009 represents an important step of the {EU} circular economy action plan with its aim to encourage the production of low cadmium content fertilizers. This paper focuses on the limits of the Regulation ({EU}) 2019/1009 and on the need for complementary policy instruments to protect and conserve agricultural soil health. We highlight the recently proposed, and subsequently withdrawn, {EU} Soil Framework Directive ({SFD}) as a meaningful complementary policy tool in the context of a renewed effort to pursue protection and conservation of soil health.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge will be obligatory in Germany from 2029. Phosphorus content determination in sewage sludge is crucial to assess the prescribed recycling rates. Currently, German law regards sample preparation using aqua regia digestion in a microwave or under reflux conditions as well as instrumental phosphorus determination by {ICP}-{OES}, {ICP}-{MS}, or photometric determination with ammonium molybdate as equivalent. However, it is questionable whether these methods are indeed equivalent regarding phosphorus quantification in sludges near the limit of 20 g/kg for mandatory recycling. To answer this question, 15 sewage sludges of 11 different wastewater treatment plants were investigated with all permitted method (digestion and measurement) combinations. Moreover, one sewage sludge was also examined in an interlaboratory comparison ({ILC}) with 28 participants. This study shows that the above-mentioned methods differ in some cases significantly but across all method combinations and sludges, phosphorus recovery was between 80 and 121\% after normalization to the grand mean (average of 15 sludges between 85 and 111\%). The {ILC} and the examination of 15 sludges produced largely similar results. There is a tendency to higher phosphorus recovery after microwave digestion compared to reflux digestion and {ICP}-{OES} measurements determine higher phosphorus contents than {ICP}-{MS} and photometric phosphorus determination. As a result, the authors recommend {ICP}-{OES} determination of phosphorus in sewage sludge after microwave digestion.},

	abstract = {Utilization of horse gram and its ﬂour in legume composite ﬂours and products is limited due to the presence of antinutritional components, poor functional and expansion properties. Enzymatic treatment was used to improve the expansion and functional properties of horse gram to facilitate its use as an ingredient in food processing. Xylanase-mediated depolymerization of cell wall polysaccharides of horse gram lead to the development of a new expanded/popped horse gram. Expansion process of enzyme treated horse gram resulted in increased length (5.3–6.8 mm) and higher yield of expanded grains (63–98\%). The expanded horse gram had lower bulk density, higher protein digestibility and more resistant starch compared to the control raw grains. Dietary ﬁbre content of raw and processed horse gram was in the range of 14.57–16.14\%. High temperature short time ({HTST}) conditions used during expansion process lowered the levels of phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors by 46\%, 61\% and 92\%, respectively. The ﬂour obtained from xylanase treated and expanded horse gram had higher water (204.3 g/100 g) and oil absorption capacities (98.4 g/100 g) than unprocessed ﬂour, which had 135.8 g/100 g and 74.6 g/100 g, respectively at ambient conditions. There was a decrease in foaming capacity and foam stability in expanded gram ﬂour. However, emulsion stability increased signiﬁcantly in the processed samples. Thus, the study indicated that nutritional value and ﬂour functionality of horse gram could be improved by processing it into a new expanded product that can be used as an ingredient in food processing.},

Protein content of these ﬂours was in the range of 22.5À24.1\%. Fat content was highest in chickpea (4.8\%) and lowest in horse gram (1.4\%). Resistant starch and phytic acid were signiﬁcantly higher in cowpea ﬂour. Compared to chickpea and cowpea, horse gram has more carbohydrate, dietary ﬁbre, polyphenols and trypsin inhibitor activity and less oligosaccharides. Horse gram and chickpea ﬂours had the highest water and oil absorption capacities with values of 148.1\% and 109.3\%, respectively. Although emulsion activity (58.1\%) and stability (52.0\%) were superior in horse gram, foaming capacity and foam stability were signiﬁcantly higher in chickpea and cowpea ﬂours, respectively. These results suggest the potential utility of cowpea and horse gram ﬂours as substitutes for chickpea ﬂour in some food products formulations.},

Rice production started around the middle of the fifteenth century, influencing Italian distinguished cuisine. Specialized cultivation is higly skilled and accounts for 70–80\% of the global rice farming surface. The crop is grown from April to October and extends over about 240 000 ha (1.4\% of the total arable area of the country). The expected production is approximately 1.4 million tonnes ({MT}) of paddy rice; average yield is about 6 t ha‾¹, 85\% of the surface being cropped with Japonica-type varieties, the rest with Thaibonnet. In last 20 years, the cultivation area has increased by about 20\%, making Italy an important riceexporting country, as the volume of exports reached 5\% of total rice traded in the world and domestic consumption hardly exceeds 40\% of total production. The main constraints in Italy are low temperature (at sowing and flowering time), diseases, weeds and red rice. Recent research has proved that the possibility exists to increase potential yield by means of varietal improvement, with emphasis on disease and lodging resistance, and better low-temperature and dry-conditions adaptability.},

As the latter is the ability of the drink to resist a change of {pH} it may add to the effects of the actual {pH}. The aim of the present study was to compare the {pH} and the buffering effect of various soft drinks with their erosive effects and the solubility of apatite. In 18 soft drinks, mineral waters and juices available on the Danish market, {pH} and the concentrations of calcium, phosphate and fluoride were determined. The buffering effect was determined by titration with {NaOH}. Human teeth (n = 54) covered with nail varnish except for 3×4–mm windows were exposed to 1.5 liters of the drink for either 7 days or 24 h under constant agitation. The depth of the erosions was assessed in longitudinal sections. The depth was found to vary greatly from 3 mm eroded by the most acidic drinks and fresh orange juice to only slightly affected surfaces by most of the mineral waters. The dissolution of enamel increased logarithmically inversely with the {pH} of the drink and parallel with the solubility of enamel apatite. Orange juice, {pH} 4.0, supplemented with 40 mmol/l calcium and 30 mmol/l phosphate did not erode the enamel as the calcium and phosphate saturated the drink with respect to apatite. Generally, the lower the {pH} the more {NaOH} was necessary to bring the {pH} to neutrality. In particular the buffering  effect of the juice was high. For all drinks, no effect of their low fluoride concentrations was observed.},

In two field experiments, Cp changes were linearly correlated with the cumulative P budget, inputs, and outputs over years. In three field experiments, the soil type effect on the relative maize(Zea {maysL}.) response curve was taken into account using the ability of soil P to replenish solution P for 1 d. Theresidual variance of this diagnosis is halved comparedto Olsen’s extraction. Although moreinformation is necessary, accuracy is improvedwhensoil testing is based on mobility . of P ions.},

	abstract = {Meeting the crops requirement for phosphorus (P) is crucial to reach the yield potential. Therefore, it is essential to determine soils´ability to supply the crop with P to identify soils in need of P fertilization and to know where P fertilization is redundant. Thirty-two field experiments with increasing rates of mineral P fertilizers (0, 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 kg P ha 1) to spring barley were carried out from 2020 to 2022 on sandy soils developed on marine or non-marine deposits in Jutland, Denmark. Soil P extraction methods representing both intensity (P extracted with demineralized water, P-water or 0.01 M calcium chloride, P-{CaCl}2) and quantity tests (P extracted with 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, Olsen-P) were evaluated by their relationship with relative yields. The examined soils had {pH} values between 4.6 and 6.7 and total P contents between 305 and 1309 mg P kg 1 soil. Yield increased after P fertilization on twelve soils in Northern Jutland (relative yields {\textless} 90 \%). Yield responsiveness occurred in all three experimental years despite differences in precipitation and temperatures among the years. Olsen-P contents were not related to yield response, and all responsive soils had moderate or high soil P status according to the Olsen-P test ({\textgreater}20 mg P kg 1 soil). Contents of P-{CaCl}2 were significantly related to the relative yields (R2 =0.39), and slightly more of the variation in relative yields was explained by the P-{CaCl}2 to Olsen-P ratio (R2 =0.43). Ten of the twelve response soils were detected with the suggested critical threshold value of 0.02 for the P-{CaCl}2 to Olsen-P ratio. Soils responsive to P fertilization on older marine (Yoldia) and moraine deposits had higher contents of amorphous aluminium oxides determined by oxalate extraction than the nonresponsive soils (+41 mmol mmol kg 1), whereas four lowland soils on younger marine (Litorina) deposits responded to P-fertilization despite low contents of oxalate extractable aluminium. We conclude that an additional P intensity test with {CaCl}2 extraction offered a much better identification of acid sandy soils requiring P fertilization than relying on the Olsen-P test alone.},

	abstract = {This is the ﬁrst in a series of papers describing the impact of two decades of no-till in the Oberacker longterm ﬁeld experiment in Switzerland. The experiment was established in 1994 on a sandy loam and compares two tillage systems, conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing ({MP}) and no-till ({NT}). Crops are grown in a six-year rotation, namely peas (Pisum sativum L.)   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)   ﬁeld beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)   winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)   sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.)   silage maize (Zea mays L.). This study investigated the impact of the two tillage systems on (i) nutrient distribution and storage in the soil proﬁle, (ii) the depth distribution of soil organic carbon and (iii) crop productivity. Soil samples were collected layer-by-layer following cultivation layers and natural soil horizons in a metal frame (0.5 m   0.5 m cross-sectional area) down to 0.5 m depth. The layer boundaries were approximately 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for {NT}, and 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for {MP}. Soil organic carbon ({SOC}), total nitrogen ({TotN}), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), {pH}, and bulk density were measured for each layer. The nutrient distribution was rather uniform within the plough layer in {MP}. In {NT}, there was strong stratiﬁcation, with higher nutrient concentrations in the upper layers for {TotN}, K and Mg. This was associated with crop residue retention on the surface and reduced plant uptake due to low {pH}. In contrast, the distribution of P and Ca in {NT} was rather uniform in the 0–30 cm layer, with a trend towards maximum concentrations at around 20 cm depth. Total storage of nutrients per ha in the whole soil proﬁle was similar in {NT} and {MP} for all nutrients. {SOC} stocks did not differ between {NT} and {MP}, although the depth distribution of {SOC} concentration was signiﬁcantly different. The long-term average crop yield was slightly higher in {NT} than in {MP}, but the difference was not signiﬁcant. Crop yield was signiﬁcantly higher in {NT} for winter cereals (winter wheat, winter barley) and legumes (ﬁeld beans and peas), but lower for root and tuber crops (sugar beet, potatoes). It can be assumed that the high crop yields in {NT} in the Oberacker long-term ﬁeld experiment are due to the well-balanced crop rotation.},

              Current understanding of phosphorus (P) cycling in soils can be enhanced by integrating previously discrete findings concerning P speciation, exchange kinetics, and the underlying biological and geochemical processes. Here, we combine sequential extraction with P

Dissolved P turned over in seconds, resin-extractable P in minutes, {NaOH}-extractable inorganic P in weeks to months, and {HCl}-extractable P in years to millennia. Furthermore, we show that in arid-zone soils, some primary mineral P remains even after 150 ky of soil development, whereas in humid-zone soils of the same age, all P in all pools has been biologically cycled. The integrative information we provide makes possible a more dynamic, process-oriented conceptual model of P cycling in soils.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung To evaluate the effect of three phosphorus (P) fertilization regimes (no P, P input equivalent to P off-take by crops, P input higher than P offtake) on crop yield, P uptake, and soil P availability, seven field experiments (six in crop rotations, one under permanent grassland) were conducted in Switzerland during nine years (six trials) or 27 years (one trial). Soil total P (Pt), inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po), and the amount of isotopically exchangeable soil P were measured in the 0±20 cm and 30±50 cm layers of the arable soils and in the 0±10 cm layer of the permanent grassland soil. Omitting P fertilization resulted in significant yield decreases only in one field crop trial as the amount of P isotopically exchangeable within one minute (E1min) reached values lower than 5 mg P (kg soil)±1. In the absence of P fertilization Pi decreased on average from 470 to 410 mg P (kg soil)±1 in the upper horizon of 6 sites while Po decreased only at two sites (from 510 to 466 mg P (kg soil)±1 on average). In all the treatments of the trials started in 1989 the E1min values of the upper horizon decreased on average from 15.6 to 7.4 mg P (kg soil)±1 between 1989 and 1998. These decreases were also observed when P inputs were higher than crops needs, showing that in these soils the highest P inputs were not sufficient to maintain the high initial available P levels. Finally for the six arable trials the values of the isotopic exchange kinetics parameters (R/r1, n, {CP}) and P exchangeable within 1 minute (E1min) at the end of the experiment could be estimated from the values measured at the beginning of trial and the cumulated P balance.},

	abstract = {Climate change will strongly influence agricultural practices in the future. In order to promote resource-efficient agriculture, it is important to analyse the impact of climate variation on crop yields. In this study, we report yields of spring wheat, winter barley, maize, potato and sugar beet from the long-term crop rotation and fertilization experiment Demo in Switzerland and analyze their response to different climate variables (e.g., annual and seasonal temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall). In addition, we investigate the impact of readily plant-available soil potassium (K) on the relationship of crop yields and precipitation. Annual and summer temperatures increased by 1 ◦C and 1.5 ◦C, respectively, over the observation period, and both the number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall increased in summer. Rising summer temperatures have a negative impact on all crop yields, which was most prominent for spring wheat, potato and maize. Annual, spring and summer precipitation show varying effects on different crops. For maize, soil K has a mediating effect on yield reductions under low spring precipitation. Yields are significantly reduced by 1 t ha 1 per 100 mm reduction of precipitation below a soil K threshold of 7 mg K kg 1 soil. Based on these results and the future climate scenarios for Switzerland, crop rotations with less heat-sensitive species and earlymaturing varieties should be considered. In order to keep future irrigation demands and costs as low as possible, the soil K fertility classes in the Swiss K fertilization guidelines might need to be revisited. Our study is one of a few long-term observations that show the impact of climate variation on crop yields and highlights the potential of K management as a climate change adaptation measure.},

Two main processes were distinguished: a fast, reversible phosphate reaction (within 1 day), which can be described by the Langmuir equation, and a precipitation reaction, which can be described by a time-dependent Freundlich equation. The maximum phosphate sorption capacity in the top 50 cm of the soil ranged from 3 to 6 t P2O5·ha−1. About 85\% to 95\% of the maximum amount of P bound was poorly soluble; the remaining portion of bound P determines the ortho-P concentration in soil solution under desorption conditions. The breakthrough curves of the two column experiments were described reasonably well by the proposed process description and the associated parameters, which were derived from batch experiments.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of poultry manure and pistachio compost with and without phosphorus fertilizer on the kinetics of phosphorus desorption in two calcareous soils of Kerman and Koohbanan farms in the southeastern of Iran. For this purpose mono potassium phosphate, at rates of 0, and 100 parts per million of phosphorus, and airdried manure, at rates of 0 and 4\% were mixed with the soils. The soils were incubated at 24–25°C and near ﬁeld capacity for 90 days in the greenhouse. Afterwards, the desorption of P was studied by the successive extraction with 0.5 M {NaHCO}3. The results of this research indicated that application of {OM} and fertilizer P combined increased P recovery in each of the extraction time, adding poultry manure and 100 mg phosphorus together to the soils, increased P desorption more than pistachio compost in the soils. The phosphorus desorption rate was initially rapid and then became slower until equilibrium was approached. Kinetic data were best described by power function and simple Elovich equations. Subsequent to these equations, parabolic diffusion equation was also well ﬁtted the timedependent P desorption data.},
