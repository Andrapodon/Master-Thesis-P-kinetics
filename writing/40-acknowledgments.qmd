# Acknowledgments
Without my wife I could have again and again found the energy and time to work on my deeply personally motivated thesis. While she gave me the space to work, she tended to our little son, who in return with his intruiging way of demanding and negotiating play-time, attention and proximity, constantly earthed and reminded me of our dependence on others. The idea for this thesis came from many lengthy discussions with Frank Liebisch, where he, although being so busy, invested so much time in my development to an agronomist during my internship. He endured over and over my harsh critique on the nature and issues of agronomic research, and understood my drustration on the limitations posed on agronomic researchers, while still giving me hope in the possibility of progress and knowledge gain. It is not common, that a master student can choose his own topic and methodology for his master thesis, Emmanuel Frossard agreed immediately upon hearing from my idea. He knew that the task I set myself was difficult and extensive, but he not only showed confidence in my ability to grow on the pitfalls and issues, he would always remind me with his charactersitic words. "Il faut avoir le courage", that acknowloding one's own limitation and ignorance and simultaneously making falsifiable claims and to stand for them, is a cardinal attitude I can grow into. The support of Frank and Emmanuel went beyond their responsibility as specialists, I will never forget the kindness and patience shown to me, knowing that I behaved often spiky and frustrated, when my abstract and often idealistic considerations met the hard reality of soil-chemisty-measurements. Gratiously Emmanuel Frossard provided me access to the group's laboratory, where Laurie Sch√∂nholzer supported me heavily, developing the protocol for my experiments. She not only shared her professional knowledge, but would also educate me on the code how to properly prepare and clean a lab. My wife reports, that I behave differently since then when it comes to our household. I benefited increadibly from this thesis. Lukas Graz introduced me to Quarto and helped me setting up a workflow, that is both safe in terms of data-loss and reproducible. He relentlessly explained me the pitfalls when using hierarchical models, aided in the selection of the effect-structure and taught me both as a friend and specialist invaluable lessons, how to structure and effiently write R-code, approaching complex real data. He encouraged me over and over, this thesis would not have been possible without him. I would also like to acknowledge the use of Google's Gemini language model in the preparation of this thesis. It served as a valuable programming assistant for debugging R and LaTeX code, and as an editorial tool for improving language, formatting, and the overall structure of the manuscript, particularly in the discussion and conclusion sections.
