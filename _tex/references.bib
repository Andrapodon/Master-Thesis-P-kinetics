Soil phosphorus was assumed to occur simultaneously in any of four primary phases: water-soluble, physically adsorbed, immobilized (or chemisorbed), and precipitated. The kinetics of reactions which control the transformation of phosphorus between any two of the four phases were considered to be reversible and of Nth order. A range of values for the reaction rate coefficients were used in the model to describe the transport of applied phosphorus in the solution phase during steady water flow through a soil initially devoid of phosphorus.},

	abstract = {ÐZusammenfassung Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is a major source of P for plants. In practice, however, plant-available P is assessed by chemical extractions solubilizing a mixture of P forms the availability of which is ill defined. We undertook an isotopic approach to assess the exchangeability of P extracted by (1) {CO}2-saturated water (P-{CO}2), (2) ammonium acetate {EDTA} (P-{AAEDTA}), and (3) sodium bicarbonate ({PNaHCO}3) compared to the exchangeability of P extracted by water. Five topsoils with similar P-fertilization histories but different soil properties were studied. Phosphorus was extracted from soils labeled with carrier-free 33P after 1 week of incubation, and the specific activity ({SA} = 33P / 31P) of the extracts was compared with the {SA} of P extracted by water to calculate the amount of P isotopically exchangeable that had been solubilized during the extraction. P-{CO}2 extracted between 20 and 100 times less P than P-{AAEDTA} and {PNaHCO}3. The {SA} of P-{CO}2 was not different from the {SA} of water-extractable P, showing that P-{CO}2 solubilized similar forms of P as water and that these forms can be considered as available. The {SA} of P extracted by the two other methods ranged between 25\% and 63\% for P-{AAEDTA} and 66\% and 92\% for P-{NaHCO}3 of the {SA} of water-extractable P. The fraction of exchangeable P extracted by {AAEDTA} decreased linearly with increasing soil {pH}, suggesting that this method dissolves slowly or non-exchangeable P from calcium phosphates.},

	abstract = {Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is the main source of P for most crops. The amount of P that is located on the solid phase of a soil and that can exchange with P in the soil solution can be calculated knowing the concentration of water-extractable P ({CP}) and two kinetic parameters: (i) the ratio between the total introduced radioactivity added as 33P in a soil/water system and the radioactivity remaining after 1 min in this solution (R/r1minute) and (ii) the rate of disappearance of 33P from the solution with time (n). The aim of this article was to propose statistical models describing R/r1minute and n as a function of {CP} and other soil properties. By doing so we made the hypothesis that it is possible, knowing {CP} and selected soil properties, to calculate the amount of P located on the solid phase of the soil that remains isotopically exchangeable after 1 min and 60 min (Pr1minute, Pr60minutes). This work was done in two steps. First, isotopic exchange kinetic experiments were carried on nine soil samples (set A) sampled in 1998 that had been incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of water-soluble P. Results from these experiments allowed development of models to calculate R/r1minute as a function of {CP}, soil {pH}, and dithionite-extractable Fe (Fed) and n as a function of {CP}. In the second step, we compared R/r1minute, n, Pr1minute, and Pr60minutes values obtained from the isotopic exchange kinetic experiments conducted on an independent set of 27 soil samples (set B) to the values computed from our statistical models. Modeled and experimental values were highly signiﬁcantly correlated to each other, showing that the three parameters {CP}, soil {pH}, and Fed explained more than 75\% of the variability of the experimental results. Experimental and modelled values of R/r1minute and Pr1minute were not different from each other, whereas experimental values of n and Pr60minutes were statistically signiﬁcantly different from the modeled values. Finally, the limits and applicability of our approach for the development of a pedotransfer function to predict Pr are discussed.},

	abstract = {Meeting the crops requirement for phosphorus (P) is crucial to reach the yield potential. Therefore, it is essential to determine soils´ability to supply the crop with P to identify soils in need of P fertilization and to know where P fertilization is redundant. Thirty-two field experiments with increasing rates of mineral P fertilizers (0, 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 kg P ha 1) to spring barley were carried out from 2020 to 2022 on sandy soils developed on marine or non-marine deposits in Jutland, Denmark. Soil P extraction methods representing both intensity (P extracted with demineralized water, P-water or 0.01 M calcium chloride, P-{CaCl}2) and quantity tests (P extracted with 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, Olsen-P) were evaluated by their relationship with relative yields. The examined soils had {pH} values between 4.6 and 6.7 and total P contents between 305 and 1309 mg P kg 1 soil. Yield increased after P fertilization on twelve soils in Northern Jutland (relative yields {\textless} 90 \%). Yield responsiveness occurred in all three experimental years despite differences in precipitation and temperatures among the years. Olsen-P contents were not related to yield response, and all responsive soils had moderate or high soil P status according to the Olsen-P test ({\textgreater}20 mg P kg 1 soil). Contents of P-{CaCl}2 were significantly related to the relative yields (R2 =0.39), and slightly more of the variation in relative yields was explained by the P-{CaCl}2 to Olsen-P ratio (R2 =0.43). Ten of the twelve response soils were detected with the suggested critical threshold value of 0.02 for the P-{CaCl}2 to Olsen-P ratio. Soils responsive to P fertilization on older marine (Yoldia) and moraine deposits had higher contents of amorphous aluminium oxides determined by oxalate extraction than the nonresponsive soils (+41 mmol mmol kg 1), whereas four lowland soils on younger marine (Litorina) deposits responded to P-fertilization despite low contents of oxalate extractable aluminium. We conclude that an additional P intensity test with {CaCl}2 extraction offered a much better identification of acid sandy soils requiring P fertilization than relying on the Olsen-P test alone.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate: (1) the kinetics of the transfer of P from soil to soil solution and assessing P buffering capacity of soils ({PBC}), as a function of soil solution P; (2) the effect of {PBC} on soil P status fitted to environmental targets for water quality; (3) the effect of {PBC} on crop response. {PBC} was derived from the non-linear Q-I curve describing the time-dependent relationship between plant-available reserve of soil P (Q) versus soil solution P (I). The Q-I curve was determined in soil suspension using sorption and isotopic dilution methods for soil samples from French, Swedish, and Dutch field trials. Soils with low {PBC} values were more sensitive to the loss of P to the environment, required higher critical value in soil solution P to comply with P demand of maize, and had higher change in soil solution P per unit of P budget. In different soils, both the critical soil solution P for maize and the change in soil solution P per unit of P balance varied inversely with {PBC}. It is concluded that (1) {PBC} plays a key role in determining the agronomic and environmental threshold levels of available P content in the soils, and (2) {PBC} is a prerequisite for the development of more environmentally oriented fertilization recommendation systems.},

The experiment was established in 1994 on a sandy loam and compares two tillage systems, conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing ({MP}) and no-till ({NT}). Crops are grown in a six-year rotation, namely peas (Pisum sativum L.)   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)   ﬁeld beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)   winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)   sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.)   silage maize (Zea mays L.). This study investigated the impact of the two tillage systems on (i) nutrient distribution and storage in the soil proﬁle, (ii) the depth distribution of soil organic carbon and (iii) crop productivity. Soil samples were collected layer-by-layer following cultivation layers and natural soil horizons in a metal frame (0.5 m   0.5 m cross-sectional area) down to 0.5 m depth. The layer boundaries were approximately 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for {NT}, and 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for {MP}. Soil organic carbon ({SOC}), total nitrogen ({TotN}), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), {pH}, and bulk density were measured for each layer. The nutrient distribution was rather uniform within the plough layer in {MP}. In {NT}, there was strong stratiﬁcation, with higher nutrient concentrations in the upper layers for {TotN}, K and Mg. This was associated with crop residue retention on the surface and reduced plant uptake due to low {pH}. In contrast, the distribution of P and Ca in {NT} was rather uniform in the 0–30 cm layer, with a trend towards maximum concentrations at around 20 cm depth. Total storage of nutrients per ha in the whole soil proﬁle was similar in {NT} and {MP} for all nutrients. {SOC} stocks did not differ between {NT} and {MP}, although the depth distribution of {SOC} concentration was signiﬁcantly different. The long-term average crop yield was slightly higher in {NT} than in {MP}, but the difference was not signiﬁcant. Crop yield was signiﬁcantly higher in {NT} for winter cereals (winter wheat, winter barley) and legumes (ﬁeld beans and peas), but lower for root and tuber crops (sugar beet, potatoes). It can be assumed that the high crop yields in {NT} in the Oberacker long-term ﬁeld experiment are due to the well-balanced crop rotation.},

Soil total P (Pt), inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po), and the amount of isotopically exchangeable soil P were measured in the 0±20 cm and 30±50 cm layers of the arable soils and in the 0±10 cm layer of the permanent grassland soil. Omitting P fertilization resulted in significant yield decreases only in one field crop trial as the amount of P isotopically exchangeable within one minute (E1min) reached values lower than 5 mg P (kg soil)±1. In the absence of P fertilization Pi decreased on average from 470 to 410 mg P (kg soil)±1 in the upper horizon of 6 sites while Po decreased only at two sites (from 510 to 466 mg P (kg soil)±1 on average). In all the treatments of the trials started in 1989 the E1min values of the upper horizon decreased on average from 15.6 to 7.4 mg P (kg soil)±1 between 1989 and 1998. These decreases were also observed when P inputs were higher than crops needs, showing that in these soils the highest P inputs were not sufficient to maintain the high initial available P levels. Finally for the six arable trials the values of the isotopic exchange kinetics parameters (R/r1, n, {CP}) and P exchangeable within 1 minute (E1min) at the end of the experiment could be estimated from the values measured at the beginning of trial and the cumulated P balance.},

	abstract = {Climate change will strongly influence agricultural practices in the future. In order to promote resource-efficient agriculture, it is important to analyse the impact of climate variation on crop yields. In this study, we report yields of spring wheat, winter barley, maize, potato and sugar beet from the long-term crop rotation and fertilization experiment Demo in Switzerland and analyze their response to different climate variables (e.g., annual and seasonal temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall). In addition, we investigate the impact of readily plant-available soil potassium (K) on the relationship of crop yields and precipitation. Annual and summer temperatures increased by 1 ◦C and 1.5 ◦C, respectively, over the observation period, and both the number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall increased in summer. Rising summer temperatures have a negative impact on all crop yields, which was most prominent for spring wheat, potato and maize. Annual, spring and summer precipitation show varying effects on different crops. For maize, soil K has a mediating effect on yield reductions under low spring precipitation. Yields are significantly reduced by 1 t ha 1 per 100 mm reduction of precipitation below a soil K threshold of 7 mg K kg 1 soil. Based on these results and the future climate scenarios for Switzerland, crop rotations with less heat-sensitive species and earlymaturing varieties should be considered. In order to keep future irrigation demands and costs as low as possible, the soil K fertility classes in the Swiss K fertilization guidelines might need to be revisited. Our study is one of a few long-term observations that show the impact of climate variation on crop yields and highlights the potential of K management as a climate change adaptation measure.},

The maximum phosphate sorption capacity in the top 50 cm of the soil ranged from 3 to 6 t P2O5·ha−1. About 85\% to 95\% of the maximum amount of P bound was poorly soluble; the remaining portion of bound P determines the ortho-P concentration in soil solution under desorption conditions. The breakthrough curves of the two column experiments were described reasonably well by the proposed process description and the associated parameters, which were derived from batch experiments.},

	abstract = {Plant available soil phosphorus contents are assessed by various different methods worldwide. The resulting country-specific methodology prohibits comparison or joint analysis of international data on yield response to soil P level. A change of the standard method would decrease comparability to older data, require new costly and time-consuming calibration and familiarization of advisory authorities and farmers. The use of conversion equations can allow the combination of data derived by different methods, but large differences between available equations question their reliability. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of conversion options from P extracted by methods commonly used in Europe (acid ammonium acetate, acid ammonium acetate + {EDTA}, ammonium lactate, calcium acetate lactate, double lactate, H2O and Mehlich 3) to the widely used Olsen method. For a given method of soil P extraction, coefficients derived from different publications often vary by factors above two. Differences in coefficients can, at least to a certain degree, be attributed to variations in soil type, soil texture and especially {pH} range and carbonate contents of the soils of the according databases. In several studies, decreasing {pH} values increased Olsen-P values in relation to the other methods. Linear regressions are prone to bias by the right-skewed distribution of P values in most databases and therefore have to be handled with care on the lower end of the P level range. Even the option most appropriate for the soil and research purpose at hand can be a considerable source of error, therefore conversions should only be conducted if absolutely necessary.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) fertilizer recommendations of individual countries may differ in many aspects, but often the main principle is to reach or maintain a target range of plant-available P in soil. Within this target P fertility class, the soil is expected to supply enough P to the crop, while P fertilization replaces what is exported by the harvested crop. However, the threshold values of the target P fertility classes are based on a multitude of different soil test P ({STP}) methods and vary by a factor of up to three, even for countries using the same {STP} method. This study aimed to provide a comparison of the thresholds of target P fertility classes of different European countries and critical soil test P values (Pcrit; {STP} below which the average relative yield falls below 95\% due to P insufficiency) derived from the analysis of data from 55 long-term field experiments in eight European countries. To overcome the issue of diverging {STP} methods, all values were converted to Olsen-P using empirically based conversion equations from the literature. Converted threshold values varied by a factor of up to five. For the experimental data, we fitted multi-level Mitscherlich-type models to determine Pcrit values of unfertilized soils corresponding to 95\% of maximum yield. We found an average Olsen-Pcrit value of 15 mg P kg−1 (adj. R² = 0.37; {RMSE} = 14.1\% relative yield; n = 2368; 55 experiments), which lies far below several country-specific thresholds of target P fertility classes. Crop-specific analyses resulted in higher Olsen-Pcrit values for sugar beet (22 mg P kg−1), potato (19 mg P kg−1) and winter rapeseed (18 mg P kg−1). Among the texture classes (loam, sand, silt and clay), sandy soils exhibited the highest average Olsen-Pcrit value (22 mg P kg−1). We consider a reevaluation of extraordinarily high country-specific thresholds as well as an inclusion of crop type and soil texture (where not already implemented) to be a reasonable measure towards more cost-effective and environment-friendly P fertilization.},

	abstract = {Many European cropped soils have high soil test P ({STP}) values in the top soil because of P accumulation over many years of fertilizer application. This should allow to save P fertilizer applications for some years without {STP} values decreasing to a level that might negatively impact crop yield. However, the way {STP} develops under omitted P fertilizer application is not well understood. We examined {STP} development under omitted P fertilizer application for timeframes between 7 and 46 years on 96 unfertilized treatments (P0 treatments) of 43 European long-term P field experiments, using five different {STP} methods. For comparability, values obtained by different {STP} methods were converted to Olsen-P concentrations. We fitted exponential decay curves to Olsen-P data of each P0 treatment defined by initial Olsen-P values (Olsen-Pi), rates of decrease (k) and asymptotes (A), reflecting minimum obtainable {STP}. Subsequently, we analysed whether the variables most commonly recorded in experiments, are sufficient to explain the variation in model parameters, these variables being P export, clay content, Corg and {pH} as well as average annual temperature and precipitation. We found that out of our predictor variables, soil clay content, precipitation and temperature were showing the most prominent effects on the parameters Olsen-Pi, A or k. However, the amount of variation explained by the considered variables was too low to potentially facilitate a prediction of {STP} decrease, and various P0 treatments showed no clear Olsen-P decrease or unexpectedly high asymptotes. This hints at a strong influence of the P sorption capacity of the soil with often high potential for replenishment from less available P pools. In connection with P introduction from the subsoil or possibly from surrounding plots, the extension of timeframes of omitted P fertilizer application without reaching critical {STP} values for crop production, might be explainable. Corresponding effects could not be analysed because of lack of data for most P0 treatments, calling for the additional determination of, for example, the maximum P sorption capacity, total P and subsoil P in future experiments.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) management in agroecosystems is driven by opposing requirements in agronomy, ecology, and environmental protection. The widely used maintenance P fertilization strategy relies on critical concentrations of soil test P ({STP}), which should cause the lowest possible impact on the environment while still ensuring optimal yield. While both soil P availability and crop yields are fundamentally related to pedoclimatic conditions, little is known about the extent to which soil and climate variables control critical {STP}. The official P fertilization guidelines for arable crops in Switzerland are based on empirically derived critical concentrations for two soil test methods (H2O-{CO}2 and {AAE}10). To validate those values and evaluate their relation to pedoclimatic conditions, we established nonlinear multivariate multilevel yield response models fitted to long-term data from six sites. The Mitscherlich function proved most suitable out of three functions and model fit was significantly enhanced by taking the multilevel data structure into account. Yield response to {STP} was strongest for potato, intermediate for barley, and lowest for wheat and maize. Mean critical {STP} at 95\% maximum yield ranged among crops from 0.15–0.58 mg kg−1 (H2O-{CO}2) and 0–36 mg kg−1 ({AAE}10). However, pedoclimatic conditions such as annual temperature or soil clay content had a large impact on critical {STP}, entailing changes of up to 0.9 mg kg−1 (H2O-{CO}2) and 80 mg kg−1 ({AAE}10). Critical {STP} for the {AAE}10 method was also affected by soil {pH}. Our findings suggest that the current Swiss fertilization guidelines overestimate actual crop P demand on average and that site conditions account for large parts of the variation in critical {STP}. We propose that site-specific fertilization recommendations could be improved on the basis of agro-climate classes in addition to soil information, which can help to counteract the accumulation of unutilized soil P by long-term P application.},

Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.

	abstract = {Soil phosphorus (P) directly impacts major sustainability outcomes, namely crop yields, water quality, and carbon sequestration. Optimally managing P to improve sustainability outcomes requires a mechanistic understanding of P availability and transfer, alongside high-resolution spatial data. However, it is unclear if current measurement techniques, models, and maps meet the demands for science-informed management. Here, we review recent advances in measuring P ﬂuxes, quantifying P availability, and mapping soil P resources and discuss implications for sustainability outcomes. We ﬁnd that the understanding of soil P availability has signiﬁcantly improved but that agronomical applications and climate models are still largely based on outdated concepts. Also, we ﬁnd that spatial data on soil P resources are highly uncertain, limiting the usefulness of current P maps. We highlight steps to improve existing tools and emphasize that these improvements need to go hand in hand with policy and technological development to successfully address P-related sustainable development goals.},
