<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soil properties and not inputs control carbon : Nitrogen : Phosphorus ratios in cropped soils in the long term;,citation_abstract=Stoichiometric approaches have been applied to understand the relationship between soil organic matter dynamics and biological nutrient transformations. However, very few studies have explicitly considered the effects of agricultural management practices on the soil C : N : P ratio. The aim of this study was to assess how different input types and rates would affect the C : N : P molar ratios of bulk soil, organic matter and microbial biomass in cropped soils in the long term. Thus, we analysed the C, N, and P inputs and budgets as well as soil properties in three long-term experiments established on different soil types: the Saria soil fertility trial (Burkina Faso), the Wagga Wagga rotation/stubble management/soil preparation trial (Australia), and the DOK (bio-Dynamic, bio-Organic, and “Konventionell”) cropping system trial (Switzerland). In each of these trials, there was a large range of C, N, and P inputs which had a strong impact on element concentrations in soils. However, although C : N : P ratios of the inputs were highly variable, they had only weak effects on soil C : N : P ratios. At Saria, a positive correlation was found between the N : P ratio of inputs and microbial biomass, while no relation was observed between the nutrient ratios of inputs and soil organic matter. At Wagga Wagga, the C : P ratio of inputs was signiﬁcantly correlated to total soil C : P, N : P, and C : N ratios, but had no impact on the elemental composition of microbial biomass. In the DOK trial, a positive correlation was found between the C budget and the C to organic P ratio in soils, while the nutrient ratios of inputs were not related to those in the microbial biomass. We argue that these responses are due to differences in soil properties among sites. At Saria, the soil is dominated by quartz and some kaolinite, has a coarse texture, a fragile structure, and a low nutrient content. Thus, microorganisms feed on inputs (plant residues, manure). In contrast, the soil at Wagga Wagga contains illite and haematite, is richer in clay and nutrients, and has a stable structure. Thus, organic matter is protected from mineralization and can therefore accumulate, allowing microorganisms to feed on soil nutrients and to keep a constant C : N : P ratio. The DOK soil represents an intermediate situation, with high nutrient concentrations, but a rather fragile soil structure, where organic matter does not accumulate. We conclude that the study of C, N, and P ratios is important to understand the functioning of cropped soils in the long term, but that it must be coupled with a precise assessment of element inputs and budgets in the system and a good understanding of the ability of soils to stabilize C, N, and P compounds.;,citation_author=Emmanuel Frossard;,citation_author=Nina Buchmann;,citation_author=Else K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluation of extractants for estimation of the phytoavailable trace metals in soils;,citation_abstract=Despite its environmental (and ﬁnancial) importance, there is no agreement in the literature as to which extractant most accurately estimates the phytoavailability of trace metals in soils.

The data suggest that generally, the total soil trace metal content, and trace metal concentrations determined by complexing agents (such as the widely used DTPA and EDTA extractants) or acid extractants (such as 0.1 M HCl and the Mehlich 1 extractant) are only poorly correlated to plant phytoavailability. Whilst there is no consensus, it would appear that neutral salt extractants (such as 0.01 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M NaNO3) provide the most useful indication of metal phytoavailability across a range of metals of interest, although further research is required.;,citation_author=Neal W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards circular phosphorus: The need of inter- and transdisciplinary research to close the broken cycle;,citation_abstract=Phosphorus (P) is an essential element to all living beings but also a ﬁnite resource. P-related problems center around broken P cycles from local to global scales. This paper presents outcomes from the 9th International Phosphorus Workshop (IPW9) held 2019 on how to move towards a sustainable P management. It is based on two sequential discussion rounds with all participants. Important progress was reported regarding the awareness of P as ﬁnite mineable resource, technologies to recycle P, and legislation towards a circular P economy. Yet, critical deﬁcits were identiﬁed such as how to handle legacy P, how climate change may affect ecosystem P cycling, or working business models to up-scale existing recycling models. Workshop participants argued for more transdisciplinary networks to narrow a perceived sciencepractice/policy gap. While this gap may be smaller in reality as illustrated with a Swiss example, we formulate recommendations how to bridge this gap more effectively.;,citation_author=Christian Stamm;,citation_author=Claudia R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soil solution phosphorus turnover: Derivation, interpretation, and insights from a global compilation of isotope exchange kinetic studies;,citation_abstract=The exchange rate of inorganic phosphorus (P) between the soil solution and solid phase, also known as soil solution P turnover, is essential for describing the kinetics of bioavailable P. While soil solution P turnover (Km) can be determined by tracing radioisotopes in a soil–solution system, few studies have done so. We believe that this is due to a lack of understanding on how to derive Km from isotopic exchange kinetic (IEK) experiments, a common form of radioisotope dilution study. Here, we provide a derivation of calculating Km using parameters obtained from IEK experiments. We then calculated Km for 217 soils from published IEK experiments in terrestrial ecosystems, and also that of 18 long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments. Analysis of the global compilation data set revealed a negative relationship between concentrations of soil solution P and Km. Furthermore, Km buffered isotopically exchangeable P in soils with low concentrations of soil solution P. This ﬁnding was supported by an analysis of long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments, which revealed a negative relationship between Km and phosphate-buffering capacity. Our study highlights the importance of calculating Km for understanding the kinetics of P between the soil solid and solution phases where it is bioavailable. We argue that our derivation can also be used to calculate soil solution turnover of other environmentally relevant and strongly sorbing elements that can be traced with radioisotopes, such as zinc, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and uranium.;,citation_author=Julian Helfenstein;,citation_author=Jannes Jegminat;,citation_author=Timothy I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soil isotopically exchangeable phosphorus: A comparison between e and l values;,citation_abstract=This study was designed to explain the apparent discrepancies often reported in the literature between £ and L values, two parameters obtained from isotopic exchange experiments and commonly used to quantify available soil phosphate. The E and L values of the surface horizons of 10 soils from tropical, mediterranean, and temperate regions were determined. The L value was measured from a 13-wk pot experiment with common bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) where the available soil P was labeled with 32PO4 ions in the presence of a carrier (25-50 mg &amp;amp;amp;quot;P kg ~’ soil). To determine the £ value, the isotopic exchange kinetic experiment was carried out on each soil. Carrier-free 32PO4 was added to the soil-solution system at a steady state and the quantity of isotopically exchangeable soil phosphate at time t, E(f), was calculated from the kinetic equation describing the decrease of radioactivity in solution with time. Results showed that L values determined after 13 wk were not significantly different from E(t) values extrapolated to the same period (&amp;lt; = 131040 min). It was concluded that (i) the L value is a particular point of the kinetic equation and (ii) isotopically exchangeable phosphate is the available P for common bentgrass. A strict equality between £(13wk) and L values was not, however, reached for all samples.

The ash was thermochemically treated in a lab-scale rotary furnace after mixing it with a chlorine-donor, either CaCl2 or MgCl2. Within each of these two sample series only a single process parameter, the reaction temperature, was varied, namely between 350 and 1050°C. It was found, that among the numerous crystalline phases present in the raw ash only quartz and hematite continue to exist after thermochemical treatments carried out at 1050°C, whereas all other components undergo at least one decomposition–recrystallization cycle. Some of the components re-crystallize even several times. It was proved that the restructuring of the calcium- and phosphorus-bearing mineral phases proceeds via the formation of chlorspodioside, Ca2PO4Cl.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting phosphate release from sewage sludge ash using an ion sink assay;,citation_abstract=Thermochemical treatments allow production of sewage sludge ash (SSA) rich in P and low in heavy metals, which could be recycled in agriculture. Our objective was to quantify P release from SSA using ion sink assays and to relate these results to P speciation in SSA and plant P uptake. Anion and cation exchange membranes saturated with different counterions (HCO3, Na, and H) were used to create a gradient in pH, P, or cation concentration between SSA particles and the surrounding solution. Phosphorus speciation in SSA was assessed using X-ray powder diffraction, and plant P uptake was determined in a pot experiment with an acidic and a neutral soil. Four SSA products were investigated: a SSA thermochemically treated with CaCl2 or MgCl2 (SSA Ca/Mg), a SSA blended with KCl, and a SSA blended with KCl and triple superphosphate (TSP) to obtain a marketable 12–20 P–K fertilizer. The H membranes dissolved all P species present in SSA. Combined HCO3/Na membranes extracted diffusible P and noncrystalline P from SSA Ca/Mg and stanfieldite from SSA Mg. Blending with KCl hardly changed P release from SSA, whereas blending with TSP masked P release. The amount of P extracted from SSA by combined HCO3/Na membranes was correlated to plant P use in the acid soil, whereas the amount of P extracted by HCO3 membranes alone was correlated to P use in the neutral soil. In conclusion, the ion sink assays delivered information on P release that was related to both SSA mineralogy and P use by plants.;,citation_author=Simone Nanzer;,citation_author=Astrid Oberson;,citation_author=Urs Eggenberger;,citation_author=Emmanuel Frossard;,citation_publication_date=2019-05;,citation_cover_date=2019-05;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.2134/jeq2018.11.0394;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.2134/jeq2018.11.0394;,citation_issn=00472425;,citation_volume=48;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Environmental Quality;,citation_journal_abbrev=J.

The transfer of P from SSACa and SSAMg to Lolium multiflorum or P pools of sequentially extracted soil-fertilizer incubations were quantified. Results The shoot P uptake from SSAMg was higher than from SSACa. For SSAMg the relative effectiveness compared to a water-soluble P fertilizer was 88 % on an acidic and 71 % on a neutral soil but only 4 % on an alkaline soil. The proportion of P derived from the fertilizer in the plant and in the first two extraction pools of soil-fertilizer incubations were strongly correlated, suggesting that it is sufficient to conduct an incubation study to obtain robust information on plant P availability.

Raman and 31P NMR spectral parameters were investigated in a series of synthetic B-type carbonated apatites (CAps). Inverse 31P NMR linewidth and inverse Raman PO43À ν1 bandwidth were both correlated with powder XRD c-axis crystallinity over the 0.3–10.3 wt% CO32À range investigated. Comparison with bone powder crystallinities showed agreement with values predicted by NMR and Raman calibration curves. Carbonate content was divided into two domains by the 31P NMR chemical shift frequency and the Raman phosphate ν1 band position. These parameters remain stable except for an abrupt transition at 6.5 wt% carbonate, a composition which corresponds to an average of one carbonate per unit cell. This near-binary distribution of spectroscopic properties was also found in AFM-measured particle sizes and Ca/P molar ratios by elemental analysis. We propose that this transition differentiates between two charge-balancing ion-loss mechanisms as measured by Ca/P ratios.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exchangeability of phosphate extracted by four chemical methods;,citation_abstract=ÐZusammenfassung Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is a major source of P for plants. In practice, however, plant-available P is assessed by chemical extractions solubilizing a mixture of P forms the availability of which is ill defined. We undertook an isotopic approach to assess the exchangeability of P extracted by (1) CO2-saturated water (P-CO2), (2) ammonium acetate EDTA (P-AAEDTA), and (3) sodium bicarbonate (PNaHCO3) compared to the exchangeability of P extracted by water. Five topsoils with similar P-fertilization histories but different soil properties were studied. Phosphorus was extracted from soils labeled with carrier-free 33P after 1 week of incubation, and the specific activity (SA = 33P / 31P) of the extracts was compared with the SA of P extracted by water to calculate the amount of P isotopically exchangeable that had been solubilized during the extraction. P-CO2 extracted between 20 and 100 times less P than P-AAEDTA and PNaHCO3. The SA of P-CO2 was not different from the SA of water-extractable P, showing that P-CO2 solubilized similar forms of P as water and that these forms can be considered as available. The SA of P extracted by the two other methods ranged between 25% and 63% for P-AAEDTA and 66% and 92% for P-NaHCO3 of the SA of water-extractable P. The fraction of exchangeable P extracted by AAEDTA decreased linearly with increasing soil pH, suggesting that this method dissolves slowly or non-exchangeable P from calcium phosphates.;,citation_author=Paolo Demaria;,citation_author=René Flisch;,citation_author=Emmanuel Frossard;,citation_author=Sokrat Sinaj;,citation_publication_date=2005-02;,citation_cover_date=2005-02;,citation_year=2005;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.200421463;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1002/jpln.200421463;,citation_issn=1436-8730, 1522-2624;,citation_volume=168;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science;,citation_journal_abbrev=Z.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soil properties and phosphorus isotopic exchangeability in cropped temperate soils;,citation_abstract=Isotopically exchangeable phosphate (P) is the main source of P for most crops. The amount of P that is located on the solid phase of a soil and that can exchange with P in the soil solution can be calculated knowing the concentration of water-extractable P (CP) and two kinetic parameters: (i) the ratio between the total introduced radioactivity added as 33P in a soil/water system and the radioactivity remaining after 1 min in this solution (R/r1minute) and (ii) the rate of disappearance of 33P from the solution with time (n). The aim of this article was to propose statistical models describing R/r1minute and n as a function of CP and other soil properties. By doing so we made the hypothesis that it is possible, knowing CP and selected soil properties, to calculate the amount of P located on the solid phase of the soil that remains isotopically exchangeable after 1 min and 60 min (Pr1minute, Pr60minutes). This work was done in two steps. First, isotopic exchange kinetic experiments were carried on nine soil samples (set A) sampled in 1998 that had been incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of water-soluble P. Results from these experiments allowed development of models to calculate R/r1minute as a function of CP, soil pH, and dithionite-extractable Fe (Fed) and n as a function of CP. In the second step, we compared R/r1minute, n, Pr1minute, and Pr60minutes values obtained from the isotopic exchange kinetic experiments conducted on an independent set of 27 soil samples (set B) to the values computed from our statistical models. Modeled and experimental values were highly signiﬁcantly correlated to each other, showing that the three parameters CP, soil pH, and Fed explained more than 75% of the variability of the experimental results. Experimental and modelled values of R/r1minute and Pr1minute were not different from each other, whereas experimental values of n and Pr60minutes were statistically signiﬁcantly different from the modeled values. Finally, the limits and applicability of our approach for the development of a pedotransfer function to predict Pr are discussed.;,citation_author=Paolo Demaria;,citation_author=Sokrat Sinaj;,citation_author=Rene Flisch;,citation_author=Emmanuel Frossard;,citation_publication_date=2013-01;,citation_cover_date=2013-01;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00103624.2013.741896;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/00103624.2013.741896;,citation_issn=0010-3624, 1532-2416;,citation_volume=44;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis;,citation_journal_abbrev=Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Decrease in soil test phosphorus levels under omitted phosphorus fertilizer application;,citation_abstract=AbstractMany European cropped soils have high soil test P (STPSTP) values in the top soil because of P accumulation over many years of fertilizer application. This should allow to save P fertilizer applications for some years without STPSTP values decreasing to a level that might negatively impact crop yield. However, the way STPSTP develops under omitted P fertilizer application is not well understood. We examined STPSTP development under omitted P fertilizer application for timeframes between 7 and 46 years on 96 unfertilized treatments (P0 treatments) of 43 European long‐term P field experiments, using five different STPSTP methods. For comparability, values obtained by different STPSTP methods were converted to Olsen‐P concentrations. We fitted exponential decay curves to Olsen‐P data of each P0 treatment defined by initial Olsen‐P values ( Olsen‐Pi), rates of decrease ( k ) and asymptotes ( A ), reflecting minimum obtainable STPSTP. Subsequently, we analysed whether the variables most commonly recorded in experiments, are sufficient to explain the variation in model parameters, these variables being P export, clay content, C org and pHpH as well as average annual temperature and precipitation. We found that out of our predictor variables, soil clay content, precipitation and temperature were showing the most prominent effects on the parameters Olsen‐Pi, A or k . However, the amount of variation explained by the considered variables was too low to potentially facilitate a prediction of STPSTP decrease, and various P0 treatments showed no clear Olsen‐P decrease or unexpectedly high asymptotes. This hints at a strong influence of the P sorption capacity of the soil with often high potential for replenishment from less available P pools. In connection with P introduction from the subsoil or possibly from surrounding plots, the extension of timeframes of omitted P fertilizer application without reaching critical STPSTP values for crop production, might be explainable. Corresponding effects could not be analysed because of lack of data for most P0 treatments, calling for the additional determination of, for example, the maximum P sorption capacity, total P and subsoil P in future experiments.;,citation_author=Kristin Steinfurth;,citation_author=Gunnar Börjesson;,citation_author=Pascal Denoroy;,citation_author=Bettina Eichler‐Löbermann;,citation_author=Wolfgang Gans;,citation_author=Johannes Heyn;,citation_author=Juliane Hirte;,citation_author=Florian Jansen;,citation_author=Dierk Koch;,citation_author=Ines Merbach;,citation_author=Alain Mollier;,citation_author=Christian Morel;,citation_author=Kerstin Panten;,citation_author=Edgar Peiter;,citation_author=Paul R.

The response of Setaria to the P treatments was clearly indicated by the DM yield and for each soil TSP was superior to either CIPR or GPR. The RAE of GPR (90%) was higher than that of CIPR (72%).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chemical and physical characteristics of phosphate rock materials of varying reactivity;,citation_abstract=Several chemical and physical properties of 10 phosphate rock (PR) materials of varying reactivity were evaluated. These included North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR), Sechura phosphate rock (SPR), Chatham Rise phosphorite (CRP), Arad phosphate rock (APR), Gafsa phosphate rock (GPR), North Florida phosphate rock (NFPR), Jordanian phosphate rock (JPR), Mexican phosphate rock (MPR), Nauru Island phosphate rock (NIPR), and Makatea Island phosphate rock (MIPR). Concentrations of As and Cd were highest in NCPR and U was higher in APR and CRP than in the other reactive PR materials. Because Cd and U can accumulate in biological systems, it may be necessary to direct more attention towards the likely implications of Cd and U concentrations when evaluating a PR for direct application. Three sequential extractions with 2% citric acid may be more useful for comparing the chemical solubility of PR materials, particularly for those containing appreciable CaCO3. For each particle-size fraction from &amp;amp;amp;lt;63 to &amp;gt;500 μm, SPR was more soluble in 2% citric acid than was NCPR. The higher solubility of SPR than NCPR in 2% citric acid, 2% formic acid, and neutral ammonium citrate possibly results from a higher chemical reactivity rather than from any difference in the surface area presented for dissolution. The poor relationship obtained between surface area and the solubility of the PR materials in the three chemical extractants suggests that surface area plays a secondary role to chemical reactivity in controlling the solubility of a PR in a chemical extractant. A Promesh plot provided an effective method for describing the particle-size characteristics of those PR materials which occurred as sands. Fundamental characteristics, such as mean particle size and uniformity, can readily be determined from a Promesh plot.;,citation_author=J. Keith Syers;,citation_author=Alec D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A simple model to describe the dissolution of phosphate rock in soils;,citation_abstract=Dissolution of phosphate rock (PR) in contrasting soils was evaluated by extraction with 0.5 M NaOH following a prewash with 1 M NaCl to remove exchangeable Ca2+. This provides a simple and direct method for measuring the rate and extent of PR dissolution in soils. Dissolution of Sechura phosphate rock (SPR) in six soils was essentially complete at 90 d and the pattern of dissolution could be described by a modified Mitscherlich equation of the form y = A (1 − e-ex), in which y = amount of SPR dissolved at time x; A = asymptote, and c = curvature coefficient. Whereas A varied markedly across soils, c was independent of soil type. This exponential equation formed the basis of a simple model which describes and predicts the dissolution of SPR in soils. By establishing the relationship between A and a range of properties for 30 contrasting soils it was possible to identify those soil parameters that controlled PR dissolution in soil. Percent Ca-saturation, P-sorption capacity, and Ca-exchange capacity of the soil were the three most important parameters influencing SPR dissolution in soils. When a model incorporating these three parameters was tested on soils not used to construct the model, the variance accounted for ranged from 66 to 76%, depending on the population of soils selected. These parameters determine the concentrations of Ca2+ and H2PO-4 in the soil solution.;,citation_author=A. D. Mackay;,citation_author=J. K. Syers;,citation_author=R. W. Tillman;,citation_author=P. E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ionic strength effects on surface charge and adsorption of phosphate and sulphate by soils;,citation_abstract=Two surface soils (Patua and Tokomaru) of contrasting mineralogy were incubated with several levels of either CaCO3 or HC1. The effects of ionic strength on pH, on surface charge, and on the adsorption of phosphate and sulphate were measured in three concentrations of NaCl. The pH at which the net surface charge was zero (point of net zero charge—PZC) was 1.8 for the Tokomaru soil and 4.6 for the Patua soil: differences that can be related to mineralogical composition. There was an analogous point of zero salt effect (PZSE) that occurred at pH 2.8 for the Tokomaru soil and at 4.6 for the Patua soil. The presence of permanent negative charge in the Tokomaru soil resulted in an increase in PZSE over PZC. The effect of ionic strength on adsorption varied greatly between phosphate and sulphate. For phosphate, there was a characteristic pH above which increasing ionic strength increased adsorption and below which the reverse occurred. This pH (PZSE for adsorption) was higher than the PZC of the soil and was 4.1 for the Tokomaru soil and 5.3 for the Patua soil. In contrast, increasing ionic strength always decreased sulphate adsorption and the adsorption curves obtained in solutions of different ionic strengths converged above pH 7.0. If increasing ionic strength decreases adsorption, the potential in the plane of adsorption must be positive. Also, if increasing ionic strength increases adsorption, the potential must be negative. This suggests that, depending upon pH, phosphate is adsorbed when the potential in the plane of adsorption is either positive or negative, whereas sulphate is absorbed only when the potential is positive.;,citation_author=N.

This P source may be especially important in soils with low concentrations of solution and labile Pi. We assessed gross Po mineralization and immobilization using labeling with 33P in four calcareous Alﬁsols with varying concentrations of Olsen soil test P that were collected from forage ﬁelds of dairy farms in Ontario, Canada. Rapid microbial 33P uptake during incubation was found for the soils with the lowest available Pi as indicated by both Olsen soil test P and water-extractable Pi. The tracer incorporation into microbial P after 8 days ranged from 7 to 44% of applied 33P and was negatively related to water-extractable Pi following a power-type relationship. As concentrations of microbial P were similar in all soils, this suggests faster turnover of P in the microbial biomass at water-extractable Pi below 0.1 mg P kgÀ1 soil. Daily gross Po mineralization rates ranged from 0.2 to 2.8 mg P kgÀ1 soil dÀ1 and contributed 7e56% of the isotopically-exchangeable P in 8 days.

Adsorption isotherms were built and electrophoretic and pH measurements were carried out in order to determine the nature of the adsorbent-adsorbate bonds. The quantity of adsorbed compound reached 5.41 umol Pi m~2, 5.06 umol G1P m’1, and 1.37 umol I6P m~2. The G1P and I6P were adsorbed on the surface hydroxyls of goethite through their phosphate groups. The proposed adsorption mechanism, notwithstanding the nature of the organic moiety, is a specific adsorption by a ligand exchange between the phosphate groups and the surface reactive hydroxyls. Inner-sphere surface complexes are formed between phosphate groups and Fe. Very little dissolution of the goethite occurred during the adsorption of either of the two ligands (GIF and I6P).

However, the majority of organic P in soil remains “unresolved” and is largely observed as a “broad” signal within the phosphomonoester region of a solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum on soil extracts. Our aim was to gain insight into the composition of four soils using the transverse relaxation (T2) time of the magnetisation in solution 31P NMR spectroscopy as a probe of their structure. We found the broad signal within the phosphomonoester region rapidly decayed compared to the sharp signals (i.e. myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate) across all soils, which corresponded to the former having a shorter T2 time than the latter, and supports the existence of a broad signal due to supra-/macro-molecular structures. Furthermore, measures of the broad signal’s line-width at half peak intensity based on T2 times were found to be less than that obtained from spectral deconvolution ﬁtting. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the broad signal is itself comprised of more than one component. The signiﬁcance of this is that the chemical nature of a large proportion of soil organic P appears to be structurally complex.;,citation_author=Timothy I.

Four stereoisomers of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) occur, although for three of these (scyllo, neo, and D-chiro) the origins, dynamics, and biological function remain unknown, due in large part to analytical limitations in their measurement in environmental samples. We synthesized authentic neo- and D-chiro-IP6 and used them to identify signals from these compounds in three soils from the Falkland Islands. Both compounds resisted hypobromite oxidation and gave quantiﬁable 31P NMR signals at δ = 6.67 ppm (equatorial phosphate groups of the 4equatorial/2-axial conformer of neo-IP6) and δ = 6.48 ppm (equatorial phosphate groups of the 2-equatorial/4-axial conformer of D-chiro-IP6) in soil extracts. Inositol hexakisphosphate accounted for 46−54% of the soil organic phosphorus, of which the four stereoisomers constituted, on average, 55.9% (myo), 32.8% (scyllo), 6.1% (neo), and 5.2% (D-chiro). Reappraisal of the literature based on the new signal assignments revealed that neo- and D-chiro-IP6 occur widely in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These results conﬁrm that the inositol phosphates can constitute a considerable fraction of the organic phosphorus in soils and reveal the prevalence of neo- and D-chiro-IP6 in the environment. The hypobromite oxidation and solution 31P NMR spectroscopy procedure allows the simultaneous quantiﬁcation of all four IP6 stereoisomers in environmental samples and provides a platform for research into the origins and ecological signiﬁcance of these enigmatic compounds.;,citation_author=Benjamin L.

We investigated Porg speciation and bioavailability in sediments collected over multiple months from a shallow, eutrophic bay in Lake Champlain (Missisquoi Bay,VT) using solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) analysis of sediments collected during years with (2008) and without (2007) algal blooms. Sediments collected during bloom onset (July) and peak bloom (August) months contained the largest proportion of enzyme-labile P, whereas pre- and postbloom sediments were primarily composed of nonlabile P. Monoester P to diester P ratios changed with respect to depth, particularly during bloom periods. Monoester P and DNA accumulation, likely from settling particulate matter, began at the onset of the bloom and continued into October 2008 during the postbloom period. The disappearance of inositol hexakisphosphate stereoisomers and the generation of orthophosphate at lower sediment depths was also evident in August 2008. Principal components analysis of EH and NMR species proportions confirmed differences between sediment cores collected during bloom onset and peak bloom, compared with pre- and postbloom sediments. Large enzymelabile and Porg species proportions corresponded to increased sediment P flux and reduced manganese and iron species in porewater. These findings suggest that interseasonal changes in Porg speciation may influence P mobility in sediments and contribute to important feedback dynamics between biological productivity and sediment water interface geochemistry.;,citation_author=Courtney D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inositol phosphates in the environment;,citation_abstract=The inositol phosphates are a group of organic phosphorus compounds found widely in the natural environment, but that represent the greatest gap in our understanding of the global phosphorus cycle. They exist as inositols in various states of phosphorylation (bound to between one and six phosphate groups) and isomeric forms (e.g. myo , D– chiro , scyllo , neo ), although myo –inositol hexakisphosphate is by far the most prevalent form in nature. In terrestrial environments, inositol phosphates are principally derived from plants and accumulate in soils to become the dominant class of organic phosphorus compounds. Inositol phosphates are also present in large amounts in aquatic environments, where they may contribute to eutrophication. Despite the prevalence of inositol phosphates in the environment, their cycling, mobility and bioavailability are poorly understood. This is largely related to analytical difficulties associated with the extraction, separation and detection of inositol phosphates in environmental samples. This review summarizes the current knowledge of inositol phosphates in the environment and the analytical techniques currently available for their detection in environmental samples. Recent advances in technology, such as the development of suitable chromatographic and capillary electrophoresis separation techniques, should help to elucidate some of the more pertinent questions regarding inositol phosphates in the natural environment.;,citation_author=Benjamin L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Can the isotopic exchange kinetic method be used in soils with a very low water extractable phosphate content and a high sorbing capacity for phosphate ions?;,citation_abstract=The isotopic exchange kinetic (IEK) method allows assessing the rate of orthophosphate ions (Pi) exchange between the solid phase and the solution of the soil with time. However, two challenges have to be tackled when using this technique in soils with a very low water extractable Pi concentration (CP) and with a high sorbing capacity for Pi. The ﬁrst is that current colorimetric methods do not allow quantifying Pi concentrations lower than 10 μg P L−1. While the second challenge is that a signiﬁcant fractionation between P isotopes may occur in the soil solution system in the presence of soils with high Pi sorption capacity. We assessed here: i) whether concentrating the blue phosphomolybdate complex (BPMC) in hexanol prior to its measurement would allow to lower the detection and quantiﬁcation limits of Pi, ii) whether a signiﬁcant isotopic fractionation between 32Pi and 33Pi could occur during IEK experiments conducted in the presence of high Pi sorbing substrates (e.g., pure goethite or Malagasy soils) and iii) whether the IEK method when used in conjunction with the hexanol concentration of the BPMC to measure CP would detect changes in Pi isotopic exchangeability in a ferralsol cropped with upland rice following the input of manure or water soluble fertilizer. The detection and quantiﬁcation limits of the BPMC concentrated by hexanol were 0.3 and 0.8 μg P L−1, respectively, using a cell of 10 cm length for the colorimetric measurement. The IEK conducted on Pi amended goethite and on Malagasy soils with 32Pi and 33Pi did not show any systematic isotopic fractionation between both isotopes, suggesting that in these soils 31Pi and 32Pi or 33Pi have a similar behavior during isotopic exchange. The analysis of the soils sampled in the ﬁeld experiment showed a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of Pi isotopically exchangeable after 1 min only after the application of water soluble P. This increase was paralleled by increases in rice yield and P export by grains demonstrating an increased P availability in this treatment. In conclusion, the IEK method can be used in low P and high Pi sorbing soils as the hexanol concentration method allows measuring very low CP and as the different P isotopes have a similar behavior in the soil/solution system. The IEK experiments conducted in the presence of goethite, however, point out to the necessity of taking into account the dispersion of particles for a proper interpretation of the isotopic data.;,citation_author=Lalajaona Randriamanantsoa;,citation_author=Christian Morel;,citation_author=Lilia Rabeharisoa;,citation_author=Jean-Marie Douzet;,citation_author=Jan Jansa;,citation_author=Emmanuel Frossard;,citation_publication_date=2013-06;,citation_cover_date=2013-06;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016706113000335;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2013.01.019;,citation_issn=00167061;,citation_volume=200-201;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Geoderma;,citation_journal_abbrev=Geoderma;">

Raman and 31P NMR spectral parameters were investigated in a series of synthetic B-type carbonated apatites (CAps). Inverse 31P NMR linewidth and inverse Raman PO43À ν1 bandwidth were both correlated with powder XRD c-axis crystallinity over the 0.3–10.3 wt% CO32À range investigated. Comparison with bone powder crystallinities showed agreement with values predicted by NMR and Raman calibration curves. Carbonate content was divided into two domains by the 31P NMR chemical shift frequency and the Raman phosphate ν1 band position. These parameters remain stable except for an abrupt transition at 6.5 wt% carbonate, a composition which corresponds to an average of one carbonate per unit cell. This near-binary distribution of spectroscopic properties was also found in AFM-measured particle sizes and Ca/P molar ratios by elemental analysis. We propose that this transition differentiates between two charge-balancing ion-loss mechanisms as measured by Ca/P ratios.

The transfer of P from SSACa and SSAMg to Lolium multiflorum or P pools of sequentially extracted soil-fertilizer incubations were quantified.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting phosphate release from sewage sludge ash using an ion sink assay;,citation_abstract=Thermochemical treatments allow production of sewage sludge ash (SSA) rich in P and low in heavy metals, which could be recycled in agriculture. Our objective was to quantify P release from SSA using ion sink assays and to relate these results to P speciation in SSA and plant P uptake. Anion and cation exchange membranes saturated with different counterions (HCO3, Na, and H) were used to create a gradient in pH, P, or cation concentration between SSA particles and the surrounding solution. Phosphorus speciation in SSA was assessed using X-ray powder diffraction, and plant P uptake was determined in a pot experiment with an acidic and a neutral soil. Four SSA products were investigated: a SSA thermochemically treated with CaCl2 or MgCl2 (SSA Ca/Mg), a SSA blended with KCl, and a SSA blended with KCl and triple superphosphate (TSP) to obtain a marketable 12–20 P–K fertilizer. The H membranes dissolved all P species present in SSA. Combined HCO3/Na membranes extracted diffusible P and noncrystalline P from SSA Ca/Mg and stanfieldite from SSA Mg. Blending with KCl hardly changed P release from SSA, whereas blending with TSP masked P release. The amount of P extracted from SSA by combined HCO3/Na membranes was correlated to plant P use in the acid soil, whereas the amount of P extracted by HCO3 membranes alone was correlated to P use in the neutral soil.

The ash was thermochemically treated in a lab-scale rotary furnace after mixing it with a chlorine-donor, either CaCl2 or MgCl2. Within each of these two sample series only a single process parameter, the reaction temperature, was varied, namely between 350 and 1050°C.

Some of the components re-crystallize even several times. It was proved that the restructuring of the calcium- and phosphorus-bearing mineral phases proceeds via the formation of chlorspodioside, Ca2PO4Cl.

The E and L values of the surface horizons of 10 soils from tropical, mediterranean, and temperate regions were determined. The L value was measured from a 13-wk pot experiment with common bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) where the available soil P was labeled with 32PO4 ions in the presence of a carrier (25-50 mg &amp;amp;amp;quot;P kg ~’ soil). To determine the £ value, the isotopic exchange kinetic experiment was carried out on each soil. Carrier-free 32PO4 was added to the soil-solution system at a steady state and the quantity of isotopically exchangeable soil phosphate at time t, E(f), was calculated from the kinetic equation describing the decrease of radioactivity in solution with time. Results showed that L values determined after 13 wk were not significantly different from E(t) values extrapolated to the same period (&amp;lt; = 131040 min). It was concluded that (i) the L value is a particular point of the kinetic equation and (ii) isotopically exchangeable phosphate is the available P for common bentgrass. A strict equality between £(13wk) and L values was not, however, reached for all samples. Possible causes for the differences were: (i) an overestimation of the water-soluble phosphate due to the presence of silica and (ii) disturbance of the steady state following a too large uptake of phosphate by the crop or the application of too large quantities of carrier compared with the initial quantity of exchangeable soil phosphate.;,citation_author=E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soil solution phosphorus turnover: Derivation, interpretation, and insights from a global compilation of isotope exchange kinetic studies;,citation_abstract=The exchange rate of inorganic phosphorus (P) between the soil solution and solid phase, also known as soil solution P turnover, is essential for describing the kinetics of bioavailable P. While soil solution P turnover (Km) can be determined by tracing radioisotopes in a soil–solution system, few studies have done so. We believe that this is due to a lack of understanding on how to derive Km from isotopic exchange kinetic (IEK) experiments, a common form of radioisotope dilution study. Here, we provide a derivation of calculating Km using parameters obtained from IEK experiments. We then calculated Km for 217 soils from published IEK experiments in terrestrial ecosystems, and also that of 18 long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments. Analysis of the global compilation data set revealed a negative relationship between concentrations of soil solution P and Km. Furthermore, Km buffered isotopically exchangeable P in soils with low concentrations of soil solution P. This ﬁnding was supported by an analysis of long-term P fertilizer ﬁeld experiments, which revealed a negative relationship between Km and phosphate-buffering capacity. Our study highlights the importance of calculating Km for understanding the kinetics of P between the soil solid and solution phases where it is bioavailable. We argue that our derivation can also be used to calculate soil solution turnover of other environmentally relevant and strongly sorbing elements that can be traced with radioisotopes, such as zinc, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and uranium.;,citation_author=Julian Helfenstein;,citation_author=Jannes Jegminat;,citation_author=Timothy I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards circular phosphorus: The need of inter- and transdisciplinary research to close the broken cycle;,citation_abstract=Phosphorus (P) is an essential element to all living beings but also a ﬁnite resource. P-related problems center around broken P cycles from local to global scales. This paper presents outcomes from the 9th International Phosphorus Workshop (IPW9) held 2019 on how to move towards a sustainable P management. It is based on two sequential discussion rounds with all participants. Important progress was reported regarding the awareness of P as ﬁnite mineable resource, technologies to recycle P, and legislation towards a circular P economy. Yet, critical deﬁcits were identiﬁed such as how to handle legacy P, how climate change may affect ecosystem P cycling, or working business models to up-scale existing recycling models. Workshop participants argued for more transdisciplinary networks to narrow a perceived sciencepractice/policy gap.

The data suggest that generally, the total soil trace metal content, and trace metal concentrations determined by complexing agents (such as the widely used DTPA and EDTA extractants) or acid extractants (such as 0.1 M HCl and the Mehlich 1 extractant) are only poorly correlated to plant phytoavailability. Whilst there is no consensus, it would appear that neutral salt extractants (such as 0.01 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M NaNO3) provide the most useful indication of metal phytoavailability across a range of metals of interest, although further research is required.;,citation_author=Neal W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The new fertilizer regulation: A starting point for cadmium control in european arable soils?;,citation_abstract=Bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd) in the agricultural soil constitutes a dangerous risk for the health of both the environment and humans. Especially in the European Union, a large amount of Cd in agricultural topsoil originates from mineral fertilizer application. In this context, the EU has recently adopted the Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 with the aim to establish stricter limits for Cd presence in fertilizer products and to promote a higher use of fertilizers from organic sources. This paper discusses the future implications of the new regulation to limit the presence of cadmium (Cd) in agricultural soils and food products. The Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 represents an important step of the EU circular economy action plan with its aim to encourage the production of low cadmium content fertilizers. This paper focuses on the limits of the Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 and on the need for complementary policy instruments to protect and conserve agricultural soil health. We highlight the recently proposed, and subsequently withdrawn, EU Soil Framework Directive (SFD) as a meaningful complementary policy tool in the context of a renewed effort to pursue protection and conservation of soil health.;,citation_author=Michele Marini;,citation_author=Dario Caro;,citation_author=Marianne Thomsen;,citation_publication_date=2020-11;,citation_cover_date=2020-11;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969720344053;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140876;,citation_issn=00489697;,citation_volume=745;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Science of The Total Environment;,citation_journal_abbrev=Science of The Total Environment;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Determination of the phosphorus content in sewage sludge: Comparison of different aqua regia digestion methods and ICP-OES, ICP-MS, and photometric determination;,citation_abstract=Phosphorus recycling from sewage sludge will be obligatory in Germany from 2029. Phosphorus content determination in sewage sludge is crucial to assess the prescribed recycling rates. Currently, German law regards sample preparation using aqua regia digestion in a microwave or under reflux conditions as well as instrumental phosphorus determination by ICP-OES, ICP-MS, or photometric determination with ammonium molybdate as equivalent. However, it is questionable whether these methods are indeed equivalent regarding phosphorus quantification in sludges near the limit of 20 g/kg for mandatory recycling. To answer this question, 15 sewage sludges of 11 different wastewater treatment plants were investigated with all permitted method (digestion and measurement) combinations. Moreover, one sewage sludge was also examined in an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) with 28 participants. This study shows that the above-mentioned methods differ in some cases significantly but across all method combinations and sludges, phosphorus recovery was between 80 and 121% after normalization to the grand mean (average of 15 sludges between 85 and 111%). The ILC and the examination of 15 sludges produced largely similar results. There is a tendency to higher phosphorus recovery after microwave digestion compared to reflux digestion and ICP-OES measurements determine higher phosphorus contents than ICP-MS and photometric phosphorus determination. As a result, the authors recommend ICP-OES determination of phosphorus in sewage sludge after microwave digestion.;,citation_author=Theresa Constanze Sichler;,citation_author=Roland Becker;,citation_author=Andreas Sauer;,citation_author=Matthias Barjenbruch;,citation_author=Markus Ostermann;,citation_author=Christian Adam;,citation_publication_date=2022-12;,citation_cover_date=2022-12;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-022-00677-1;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12302-022-00677-1;,citation_issn=2190-4707, 2190-4715;,citation_volume=34;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Environmental Sciences Europe;,citation_journal_abbrev=Environ Sci Eur;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nutritional implications and flour functionality of popped/expanded horse gram;,citation_abstract=Utilization of horse gram and its ﬂour in legume composite ﬂours and products is limited due to the presence of antinutritional components, poor functional and expansion properties. Enzymatic treatment was used to improve the expansion and functional properties of horse gram to facilitate its use as an ingredient in food processing. Xylanase-mediated depolymerization of cell wall polysaccharides of horse gram lead to the development of a new expanded/popped horse gram. Expansion process of enzyme treated horse gram resulted in increased length (5.3–6.8 mm) and higher yield of expanded grains (63–98%). The expanded horse gram had lower bulk density, higher protein digestibility and more resistant starch compared to the control raw grains. Dietary ﬁbre content of raw and processed horse gram was in the range of 14.57–16.14%. High temperature short time (HTST) conditions used during expansion process lowered the levels of phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors by 46%, 61% and 92%, respectively. The ﬂour obtained from xylanase treated and expanded horse gram had higher water (204.3 g/100 g) and oil absorption capacities (98.4 g/100 g) than unprocessed ﬂour, which had 135.8 g/100 g and 74.6 g/100 g, respectively at ambient conditions. There was a decrease in foaming capacity and foam stability in expanded gram ﬂour. However, emulsion stability increased signiﬁcantly in the processed samples. Thus, the study indicated that nutritional value and ﬂour functionality of horse gram could be improved by processing it into a new expanded product that can be used as an ingredient in food processing.;,citation_author=Yadahally N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rice cultivation in italy under the threat of climatic change: Trends, technologies and research gaps;,citation_abstract=Italy is the largest rice-producing country in the European Union: more than two-thirds of Europe’s rice with about 60% of the national production exported, mainly to Mediterranean countries and Eastern Europe. Rice production started around the middle of the fifteenth century, influencing Italian distinguished cuisine. Specialized cultivation is higly skilled and accounts for 70–80% of the global rice farming surface. The crop is grown from April to October and extends over about 240 000 ha (1.4% of the total arable area of the country). The expected production is approximately 1.4 million tonnes (MT) of paddy rice; average yield is about 6 t ha‾¹, 85% of the surface being cropped with Japonica-type varieties, the rest with Thaibonnet. In last 20 years, the cultivation area has increased by about 20%, making Italy an important riceexporting country, as the volume of exports reached 5% of total rice traded in the world and domestic consumption hardly exceeds 40% of total production. The main constraints in Italy are low temperature (at sowing and flowering time), diseases, weeds and red rice. Recent research has proved that the possibility exists to increase potential yield by means of varietal improvement, with emphasis on disease and lodging resistance, and better low-temperature and dry-conditions adaptability.;,citation_author=Marco Arcieri;,citation_author=Graziano Ghinassi;,citation_publication_date=2020-10;,citation_cover_date=2020-10;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ird.2472;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1002/ird.2472;,citation_issn=1531-0353, 1531-0361;,citation_volume=69;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Irrigation and Drainage;,citation_journal_abbrev=Irrig. and Drain.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Enamel erosion by some soft drinks and orange juices relative to their pH, buffering effect and contents of calcium phosphate;,citation_abstract=The capability of a soft drink or a juice to erode dental enamel depends not only on the pH of the drink, but also on its buffering effect. As the latter is the ability of the drink to resist a change of pH it may add to the effects of the actual pH. The aim of the present study was to compare the pH and the buffering effect of various soft drinks with their erosive effects and the solubility of apatite. In 18 soft drinks, mineral waters and juices available on the Danish market, pH and the concentrations of calcium, phosphate and fluoride were determined. The buffering effect was determined by titration with NaOH. Human teeth (n = 54) covered with nail varnish except for 3×4–mm windows were exposed to 1.5 liters of the drink for either 7 days or 24 h under constant agitation. The depth of the erosions was assessed in longitudinal sections. The depth was found to vary greatly from 3 mm eroded by the most acidic drinks and fresh orange juice to only slightly affected surfaces by most of the mineral waters. The dissolution of enamel increased logarithmically inversely with the pH of the drink and parallel with the solubility of enamel apatite. Orange juice, pH 4.0, supplemented with 40 mmol/l calcium and 30 mmol/l phosphate did not erode the enamel as the calcium and phosphate saturated the drink with respect to apatite. Generally, the lower the pH the more NaOH was necessary to bring the pH to neutrality. In particular the buffering effect of the juice was high. For all drinks, no effect of their low fluoride concentrations was observed.;,citation_author=M. J. Larsen;,citation_author=B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Additional phosphorus intensity analysis needed to identify phosphorus requirement on acid sandy soils with high olsen-p contents;,citation_abstract=Meeting the crops requirement for phosphorus (P) is crucial to reach the yield potential. Therefore, it is essential to determine soils´ability to supply the crop with P to identify soils in need of P fertilization and to know where P fertilization is redundant. Thirty-two field experiments with increasing rates of mineral P fertilizers (0, 7.5, 15, 30 and 60 kg P ha 1) to spring barley were carried out from 2020 to 2022 on sandy soils developed on marine or non-marine deposits in Jutland, Denmark. Soil P extraction methods representing both intensity (P extracted with demineralized water, P-water or 0.01 M calcium chloride, P-CaCl2) and quantity tests (P extracted with 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, Olsen-P) were evaluated by their relationship with relative yields. The examined soils had pH values between 4.6 and 6.7 and total P contents between 305 and 1309 mg P kg 1 soil. Yield increased after P fertilization on twelve soils in Northern Jutland (relative yields &amp;amp;amp;lt; 90 %). Yield responsiveness occurred in all three experimental years despite differences in precipitation and temperatures among the years. Olsen-P contents were not related to yield response, and all responsive soils had moderate or high soil P status according to the Olsen-P test (&amp;gt;20 mg P kg 1 soil). Contents of P-CaCl2 were significantly related to the relative yields (R2 =0.39), and slightly more of the variation in relative yields was explained by the P-CaCl2 to Olsen-P ratio (R2 =0.43). Ten of the twelve response soils were detected with the suggested critical threshold value of 0.02 for the P-CaCl2 to Olsen-P ratio. Soils responsive to P fertilization on older marine (Yoldia) and moraine deposits had higher contents of amorphous aluminium oxides determined by oxalate extraction than the nonresponsive soils (+41 mmol mmol kg 1), whereas four lowland soils on younger marine (Litorina) deposits responded to P-fertilization despite low contents of oxalate extractable aluminium. We conclude that an additional P intensity test with CaCl2 extraction offered a much better identification of acid sandy soils requiring P fertilization than relying on the Olsen-P test alone.;,citation_author=Ingeborg Frøsig Pedersen;,citation_author=Lars J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Two decades of no-till in the oberacker long-term field experiment: Part i. Crop yield, soil organic carbon and nutrient distribution in the soil profile;,citation_abstract=This is the ﬁrst in a series of papers describing the impact of two decades of no-till in the Oberacker longterm ﬁeld experiment in Switzerland. The experiment was established in 1994 on a sandy loam and compares two tillage systems, conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing (MP) and no-till (NT). Crops are grown in a six-year rotation, namely peas (Pisum sativum L.) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ﬁeld beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) silage maize (Zea mays L.). This study investigated the impact of the two tillage systems on (i) nutrient distribution and storage in the soil proﬁle, (ii) the depth distribution of soil organic carbon and (iii) crop productivity. Soil samples were collected layer-by-layer following cultivation layers and natural soil horizons in a metal frame (0.5 m 0.5 m cross-sectional area) down to 0.5 m depth. The layer boundaries were approximately 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for NT, and 0.15, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50 m for MP. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TotN), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), pH, and bulk density were measured for each layer. The nutrient distribution was rather uniform within the plough layer in MP. In NT, there was strong stratiﬁcation, with higher nutrient concentrations in the upper layers for TotN, K and Mg. This was associated with crop residue retention on the surface and reduced plant uptake due to low pH. In contrast, the distribution of P and Ca in NT was rather uniform in the 0–30 cm layer, with a trend towards maximum concentrations at around 20 cm depth. Total storage of nutrients per ha in the whole soil proﬁle was similar in NT and MP for all nutrients. SOC stocks did not differ between NT and MP, although the depth distribution of SOC concentration was signiﬁcantly different. The long-term average crop yield was slightly higher in NT than in MP, but the difference was not signiﬁcant. Crop yield was signiﬁcantly higher in NT for winter cereals (winter wheat, winter barley) and legumes (ﬁeld beans and peas), but lower for root and tuber crops (sugar beet, potatoes). It can be assumed that the high crop yields in NT in the Oberacker long-term ﬁeld experiment are due to the well-balanced crop rotation.;,citation_author=Ingrid Martínez;,citation_author=Andreas Chervet;,citation_author=Peter Weisskopf;,citation_author=Wolfgang G.

Dissolved P turned over in seconds, resin-extractable P in minutes, NaOHNaOH-extractable inorganic P in weeks to months, and HClHCl-extractable P in years to millennia. Furthermore, we show that in arid-zone soils, some primary mineral P remains even after 150 ky of soil development, whereas in humid-zone soils of the same age, all P in all pools has been biologically cycled.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of phosphate fertilization on crop yield and soil phosphorus status;,citation_abstract=Zusammenfassung To evaluate the effect of three phosphorus (P) fertilization regimes (no P, P input equivalent to P off-take by crops, P input higher than P offtake) on crop yield, P uptake, and soil P availability, seven field experiments (six in crop rotations, one under permanent grassland) were conducted in Switzerland during nine years (six trials) or 27 years (one trial). Soil total P (Pt), inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po), and the amount of isotopically exchangeable soil P were measured in the 0±20 cm and 30±50 cm layers of the arable soils and in the 0±10 cm layer of the permanent grassland soil. Omitting P fertilization resulted in significant yield decreases only in one field crop trial as the amount of P isotopically exchangeable within one minute (E1min) reached values lower than 5 mg P (kg soil)±1. In the absence of P fertilization Pi decreased on average from 470 to 410 mg P (kg soil)±1 in the upper horizon of 6 sites while Po decreased only at two sites (from 510 to 466 mg P (kg soil)±1 on average). In all the treatments of the trials started in 1989 the E1min values of the upper horizon decreased on average from 15.6 to 7.4 mg P (kg soil)±1 between 1989 and 1998. These decreases were also observed when P inputs were higher than crops needs, showing that in these soils the highest P inputs were not sufficient to maintain the high initial available P levels. Finally for the six arable trials the values of the isotopic exchange kinetics parameters (R/r1, n, CP) and P exchangeable within 1 minute (E1min) at the end of the experiment could be estimated from the values measured at the beginning of trial and the cumulated P balance.;,citation_author=Anne Gallet;,citation_author=René Flisch;,citation_author=Jean‐Pierre Ryser;,citation_author=Emmanuel Frossard;,citation_author=Sokrat Sinaj;,citation_publication_date=2003-10-13;,citation_cover_date=2003-10-13;,citation_year=2003;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.200321081;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1002/jpln.200321081;,citation_issn=1436-8730, 1522-2624;,citation_volume=166;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science;,citation_journal_abbrev=Z.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of climate and potassium nutrition on crop yields: Insights from a 30-year swiss long-term fertilization experiment;,citation_abstract=Climate change will strongly influence agricultural practices in the future. In order to promote resource-efficient agriculture, it is important to analyse the impact of climate variation on crop yields. In this study, we report yields of spring wheat, winter barley, maize, potato and sugar beet from the long-term crop rotation and fertilization experiment Demo in Switzerland and analyze their response to different climate variables (e.g., annual and seasonal temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall). In addition, we investigate the impact of readily plant-available soil potassium (K) on the relationship of crop yields and precipitation. Annual and summer temperatures increased by 1 ◦C and 1.5 ◦C, respectively, over the observation period, and both the number of heat days and days of heavy rainfall increased in summer. Rising summer temperatures have a negative impact on all crop yields, which was most prominent for spring wheat, potato and maize. Annual, spring and summer precipitation show varying effects on different crops. For maize, soil K has a mediating effect on yield reductions under low spring precipitation. Yields are significantly reduced by 1 t ha 1 per 100 mm reduction of precipitation below a soil K threshold of 7 mg K kg 1 soil. Based on these results and the future climate scenarios for Switzerland, crop rotations with less heat-sensitive species and earlymaturing varieties should be considered. In order to keep future irrigation demands and costs as low as possible, the soil K fertility classes in the Swiss K fertilization guidelines might need to be revisited. Our study is one of a few long-term observations that show the impact of climate variation on crop yields and highlights the potential of K management as a climate change adaptation measure.;,citation_author=Jonathan Frei;,citation_author=Guido L.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<section id="the-complexity-of-phosphorus" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-complexity-of-phosphorus">The Complexity of Phosphorus</h2>
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all known life, forming a critical part of DNA and energy-transfer molecules. In soils—where organic, mineral, and aqueous phases interface—its behavior is complex. In the presence of oxygen, P exists almost exclusively as orthophosphate (<span class="math inline">\(PO_4^{3-}\)</span>) and its protonated forms (<span class="math inline">\(HPO_4^{2-}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_2PO_4^{-}\)</span>), depending on the soil pH. These dissolved phosphate species are highly reactive; they are subject to adsorption onto the surfaces of clays and oxides and can precipitate with cations like calcium, iron, and aluminum to form minerals with low solubility. Consequently, while the total amount of P in a soil can be large, only a small fraction is in the soil solution at any given moment, posing a central challenge for agriculture. The efficacy of P fertilization is often low due to these rapid immobilization processes, and P lost from agricultural fields can become an environmental pollutant, disturbing P-limited aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Soil organic matter (SOM) adds another layer of complexity to these interactions.</strong> Organic acids released during the decomposition of SOM can compete with phosphate for the same adsorption sites on mineral surfaces, which can increase P concentrations in the soil solution. Furthermore, humic substances can form stable complexes with cations like Al³⁺ and Fe³⁺, preventing them from precipitating phosphate and thereby enhancing its availability. The efficacy of P fertilization is often low due to these rapid and competing immobilization processes, and P lost from agricultural fields can become an environmental pollutant, disturbing P-limited aquatic ecosystems. ## From Static Measurements to Dynamic Understanding</p>
<p>To manage this challenge, traditional soil testing methods (e.g., Olsen-P, AAE10, CO₂-water) were developed to quantify the <strong>size of the readily available P pool</strong>. This static measurement is often referred to as the <strong>“capacity factor”</strong>. While these tests are invaluable for basic fertility assessment, they do not capture the dynamic nature of P supply. A crucial missing piece of information is the rate at which P is replenished into the soil solution from the solid phase after being taken up by plant roots. This replenishment rate, or <strong>“kinetic factor”</strong>, is vital for sustaining crop growth, especially during periods of high demand.</p>
<p>The importance of these dynamics is not a new concept. As early as 1982, <strong>Flossmann and Richter</strong> argued that characterizing the kinetics of P release was essential for refining fertilizer recommendations beyond what static tests alone could offer. Modern research has reinforced this view, showing that fertilization strategies based solely on maintaining a critical soil test P (STP) concentration can be inefficient. In Switzerland, this has led to the accumulation of “legacy P” in many agricultural soils, and understanding the release kinetics of this legacy P is key to both improving nutrient efficiency and protecting water quality. Furthermore, critical STP levels are not constant; they are influenced by pedoclimatic factors like soil texture and temperature, making a “one-size-fits-all” approach to fertilization suboptimal.</p>

<section id="objectives-and-research-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives-and-research-questions">Objectives and Research Questions</h2>
<p>An ideal set of parameters for P management should meet several criteria. The parameters should correlate strongly with P export and P balance in a steady-state system. They must also respond to fertilizer inputs and, most importantly, capture the diffusive, kinetic nature of P supply to plant roots.</p>
<p>This thesis hypothesizes that <strong>kinetic parameters describing P desorption, derived from a simple laboratory extraction, can serve as effective predictors for agronomic outcomes.</strong> Using soils from the long-term STYCS experiment in Switzerland, this study employs a modified version of the Flossmann &amp; Richter kinetic test to derive the desorption rate (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) and the desorbable P pool (<span class="math inline">\(P^S\)</span>). The performance of these new kinetic parameters will be compared against standard STP methods (<span class="math inline">\(P_{CO_2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_{AAE10}\)</span>) by addressing the following research questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the P desorption kinetic method replicable and effective for the soils from the STYCS trial?</li>
<li>How do the kinetic coefficients, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P^S\)</span>, correlate with key soil properties (organic carbon, clay content, pH)?</li>
<li>How well do the standard STP methods (<span class="math inline">\(P_{CO_2}\)</span> &amp; <span class="math inline">\(P_{AAE10}\)</span>) predict crop yield, P export, and P balance?</li>
<li>Can the kinetic parameters, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P^S\)</span>, improve the prediction of these agronomic outcomes compared to the standard static tests?</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-long-term-phosphorus-fertilization-experiment">The Long-Term Phosphorus Fertilization Experiment</h2>
<p>The soil samples for this thesis originate from a set of six long-term field trials in Switzerland, established by Agroscope between 1989 and 1992. The primary objective of these experiments was to validate and re-evaluate Swiss phosphorus (P) fertilization guidelines by assessing long-term crop yield responses to varying P inputs across different pedoclimatic conditions. A detailed description of the experimental design and site characteristics can be found in Hirte et al.&nbsp;(2021).</p>
<p>The experiment was set up as a <strong>completely randomized block design</strong> with four field replications at each site. The core of the experiment consists of six fixed-plot treatments representing different P fertilization levels, which were applied annually as superphosphate before tillage and sowing. These levels were based on percentages of the officially recommended P inputs: 0% (Zero), 33% (Deficit), 67% (Reduced), 100% (Norm), 133% (Elevated), and 167% (Surplus).</p>

<section id="experimental-sites" class="level2">

<p>The analysis of phosphorus (P) desorption kinetics was based on the principles of sequential extraction established by Flossmann and Richter (1982). The original method is described below, followed by the specific protocol adapted for this study.</p>
<section id="original-method-of-flossmann-and-richter-1982" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="original-method-of-flossmann-and-richter-1982">Original Method of Flossmann and Richter (1982)</h3>
<p>The foundational method aims to characterize the P replenishment capacity of the soil. The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Removal of Soluble P</strong>: 17.5 g of air-dried soil is shaken with 350 ml of deionized water for one hour at 25 ± 1°C. The suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant is decanted to remove the readily soluble P fraction. This first extract is referred to as:
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution A</strong>: Contains easily soluble P, which is discarded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kinetic Extraction</strong>: The remaining soil pellet is resuspended with another 350 ml of deionized water. Subsamples of the suspension are taken at specific time intervals, yielding the following extracts for kinetic analysis:
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution B</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>10 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Solution C</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Solution D</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>120 minutes</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: The P concentration in Solutions B, C, and D is determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue method according to Murphy and Riley (1962).</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adapted-kinetic-protocol-for-this-study">Adapted Kinetic Protocol for This Study</h3>
<p>For this thesis, the original method was modified to capture the desorption process with a higher temporal resolution and using a different soil-to-solution ratio.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Soil Suspension</strong>: 10 g of air-dried soil was suspended in 200 ml of deionized water. Unlike the original protocol, a pre-washing step to remove soluble P was not performed, meaning the measured desorption includes both the release of readily soluble P and the subsequent replenishment from the solid phase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kinetic Extraction</strong>: The suspension was shaken continuously, and subsamples were taken at eight time points to generate a detailed kinetic curve. The resulting extracts were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extract 1</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>2 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 2</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>4 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 3</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>10 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 4</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>15 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 5</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>20 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 6</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 7</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>45 minutes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extract 8</strong>: Subsample taken after <strong>60 minutes</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Each subsample was immediately filtered. The concentration of orthophosphate in the filtered extracts was determined colorimetrically using the <strong>malachite green method</strong>.</p></li>

<p>The statistical workflow involved two main stages: 1) estimating the P desorption kinetic parameters from the laboratory data, and 2) using these parameters to model the agronomic outcomes from the long-term field experiment.</p>
<section id="modeling-of-desorption-kinetics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modeling-of-desorption-kinetics">Modeling of Desorption Kinetics</h3>
<p>To derive the kinetic parameters, a non-linear mixed-effects model (<code>nlme</code>) was implemented. This approach was chosen to simultaneously estimate the rate constant (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) and the maximum desorbable P (<span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span>) directly from the time-series data for each soil sample. The model was fitted to the exact solution of the first-order rate equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(t) = P_{desorb} \times (1 - e^{-k \times t'}) \]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(P(t)\)</span> is the P concentration at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t'\)</span> is an adjusted time (<span class="math inline">\(t_\text{min} + 3\)</span> min) to account for rapid initial P dissolution. The overall means for <span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> were modeled as <strong>fixed effects</strong>, while sample-specific deviations for both parameters were modeled as <strong>random effects</strong> to capture the unique characteristics of each soil sample.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-mixed-effects-model-structure">Linear Mixed-Effects Model Structure</h4>
<p>Linear mixed-effects models (<code>lmer</code>) were used to test the relationships between the predictor variables and each of the three response variables. The structure of these models was designed to account for the nested nature of the long-term experiment. A general form of the model is:</p>
<p><em>Response Variable ~ Fixed Effects + (1 | Random Effects)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Effects</strong>: These represent the main explanatory variables of interest whose effects we wanted to quantify. The fixed effects included the kinetic parameters (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(J_0\)</span>) and the standard soil P tests (<span class="math inline">\(P_w\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_{AAE10}\)</span>), along with their interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Random Effects</strong>: These were included to control for non-independence among observations. By including <code>(1 | Site)</code>, <code>(1 | Year)</code>, and <code>(1 | Crop)</code> as random intercepts, the model accounts for baseline differences in the response variable that are attributable to the specific location, growing season, or crop type, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the fixed effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>To identify the most informative and parsimonious model, a systematic feature selection process was conducted using the <code>mlr3</code> machine learning framework. This involved training and evaluating different combinations of predictor variables using nested cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the final selected model.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment, utilizing the <code>nlme</code> package for kinetic modeling and the <code>lme4</code>, <code>lmerTest</code>, and <code>mlr3</code> packages for the final agronomic modeling and feature selection.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>The results of this study are presented in two main parts. First, the direct effects of the long-term phosphorus (P) fertilization treatments on both the agronomic outcomes and the soil P test parameters are explored visually. This descriptive analysis provides an overview of the main trends across the different experimental sites. Second, the relationships between the soil P predictors and the agronomic responses are formally evaluated using linear mixed-effects models.</p>

<p>To visualize the primary effects of the long-term P fertilization treatments, the key response and predictor variables were plotted for each treatment level across all six experimental sites.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="agronomic-responses-to-p-fertilization">Agronomic Responses to P Fertilization</h3>
<p>The long-term application of different P fertilization levels had a pronounced impact on the primary agronomic outcomes, including two different metrics for yield, P Uptake (<span class="math inline">\(P_{up}\)</span>), and P Balance (<span class="math inline">\(P_{bal}\)</span>). The response, however, varied considerably between the different sites (Figure X.1).</p>

<p><strong>Yield Metrics (<span class="math inline">\(Y_{norm}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{rel}\)</span>):</strong> Both yield metrics, now displayed as percentages, showed a generally positive response to P fertilization, especially at the lower treatment levels. The site-normalized yield (<span class="math inline">\(Y_{norm}\)</span>) clearly shows the response relative to the site’s potential for that year, with most yields plateauing around the Norm (100%) treatment. The national-normalized yield (<span class="math inline">\(Y_{rel}\)</span>) provides a broader context, showing how the yields at each site compare to the national average. At some high-productivity sites, even the zero-P treatment produced yields above the national average (i.e., &gt; 100%), while at others, yields remained below average even with high fertilization.</p>
<p><strong>P Uptake (<span class="math inline">\(P_{up}\)</span>):</strong> Phosphorus uptake by crops followed a similar trend to yield, increasing with fertilization. However, unlike yield, P uptake often continued to increase at the highest fertilization levels. This suggests that at high P supply, plants engaged in “luxury consumption,” taking up more P than was required for additional biomass production.</p>
<p><strong>P Balance (<span class="math inline">\(P_{bal}\)</span>):</strong> The P balance showed a strong, linear relationship with the fertilization treatment, which is expected by definition. The Zero and Deficit treatments consistently resulted in a negative P balance, indicating that crops were mining P from soil reserves. The Norm treatment was generally close to a neutral balance, while the Elevated and Surplus treatments led to a significant P surplus, contributing to the accumulation of legacy P in the soil.</p>

<p><em>(Placeholder for Figure X.2)</em></p>
<p><strong>Standard STPs (<span class="math inline">\(P_{CO_2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_{AAE10}\)</span>):</strong> Both standard soil P tests showed a clear and consistent increase with rising P fertilization levels across all sites. This confirms that both methods are sensitive to changes in the soil P status resulting from long-term management. The absolute values, however, differed significantly between sites, reflecting the influence of soil properties like clay content and pH on P retention.</p>
<p><strong>Kinetic Parameters (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(J_0\)</span>):</strong> * <strong>Desorbable P (<span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span>):</strong> This parameter, representing the size of the readily desorbable P pool, behaved very similarly to the standard STPs. It increased steadily with P fertilization, confirming its role as a “capacity” indicator. * <strong>Rate Constant (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>):</strong> The rate constant, representing the speed of P release, showed a more complex pattern. At most sites, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> did not show a strong, consistent trend with fertilization, or in some cases, it slightly decreased at very high P levels. This suggests that while fertilization increases the <em>amount</em> of available P, it may not necessarily increase the intrinsic <em>release rate</em> from the soil matrix. * <strong>Initial P Flux (<span class="math inline">\(J_0\)</span>):</strong> As the product of <span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the initial P flux integrates both the size of the pool and its release rate. It showed a strong positive response to fertilization, driven primarily by the increase in <span class="math inline">\(P_{desorb}\)</span>. This parameter effectively captures the overall P-supplying power of the soil.</p>
<p>These initial observations suggest that while all P metrics are sensitive to fertilization, the kinetic parameters, particularly the rate constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, may provide unique information about the soil’s P dynamics that is not captured by static tests alone. The next section will use formal statistical models to test these relationships.</p>
