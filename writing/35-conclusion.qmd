### Conclusion and Outlook

This thesis set out to test the hypothesis that P desorption kinetics, grounded in the diffusion-limited reality of P uptake, would provide a superior prediction of agronomic outcomes compared to conventional static soil tests (STPs). The first step required a critical re-evaluation of the kinetic methodology itself. We successfully demonstrated that the original linearized approach of Flossmann & Richter (1982) is based on a chemically flawed premise, where the estimated desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) far exceeds the physical solubility of phosphate. By implementing a direct non-linear modeling approach, we derived robust kinetic parameters free from these assumptions. However, this refined method remains sensitive, as evidenced by outlier replicates that were ultimately attributed to the "nugget effect" of residual fertilizer granules, a persistent challenge in soil analysis.

The comparative analysis of the predictive models yielded a nuanced picture. Contrary to our primary hypothesis, the kinetic parameters were not universally superior. For predicting site- and national-normalized yield ($Y_{norm}$, $Y_{rel}$) and P-uptake ($P_{up}$), the kinetic model offered no significant advantage and, in some cases, performed worse than standard STP methods. This strongly suggests that under the conditions of the STYCS trial, where P was likely not the primary limiting factor for yield due to a history of adequate fertilization, the subtle differences in P supply dynamics were overshadowed by larger environmental drivers.

However, the most striking finding of this study was the exceptional success of the kinetic model in predicting the **P-Balance ($P_{bal}$)**. While STP methods completely failed, the desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) alone explained over 57% of the variance in the long-term nutrient budget. The interpretation of this is critical: the P-Balance is an indicator of nutrient stewardship and environmental risk. A soil with a highly positive P-Balance has a large store of "legacy P," which can sustain future crops but also poses a risk of loss to the environment. The success of `$P_{desorb}$` as a predictor means it is a far superior metric for assessing this long-term soil P status and sustainability than conventional STPs.

Furthermore, this study provides evidence questioning the concurrent use of multiple STP methods. While systems like GRUD and VDLUFA employ two tests to differentiate P-intensity and P-capacity, our models showed that $P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$ contained largely redundant information for predicting agronomic outcomes. The non-significant interaction term indicated that combining them did not improve predictions. This is a crucial finding, suggesting that while these methods may extract chemically distinct P pools—as shown by the isotopic exchange data from Demaria et al.—this chemical difference does not translate into a functional difference for agronomic modeling in this context.

Looking forward, this work should be seen as a successful "beta-trial" for a promising, mechanistically-grounded soil testing approach. The current kinetic protocol is in dire need of refinement to improve its robustness. The centrifugation step (4000 rpm for 15 minutes) created highly compact sediments, particularly in clay-rich soils. Consequently, the magnetic stir bar required considerable time (up to 10 minutes) to achieve full resuspension, meaning the reactive surface area was not constant at the beginning of the experiment, violating a key assumption of kinetic modeling. Furthermore, the decanting process left a residue of P-rich colloids on the sediment surface, which, upon resuspension, likely contributed to an immediate release of P, invalidating the assumption of P(t=0)=0 and necessitating a time correction in our model.

More fundamentally, a soil suspension with a 1:20 soil-to-water ratio is a highly artificial system that does not reflect the conditions at an intact soil-matrix to soil-solution interface. The process of suspension creates new reactive surfaces while simultaneously diluting sorption sites, and it remains an open question how kinetic parameters derived from such a system translate to the processes occurring in a structured field soil. A crucial element missing from all such chemical extractions is the **active plant sink**. A plant root constantly removes phosphate from the solution, fundamentally altering the chemical equilibrium. The rate of uptake is not a simple chemical reaction but is governed by biological Michaelis-Menten kinetics of membrane transporters. How the purely chemical rate constant (*k*) from a lab experiment corresponds to the biologically-driven P flux in the rhizosphere is unknown and represents a key knowledge gap that must be studied to understand how far these artificial results can be extrapolated to field conditions.

The primary limitation of this study was the experimental context, which also informs the most promising directions for future research. A more robust approach would be to deconstruct composite response variables like $P_{up}$. Future studies should model crop **yield** and plant P **concentration** separately. Yield should be predicted using the primary agronomic drivers (N supply, climate variables like temperature and precipitation, soil texture), while the P concentration in plant tissue should be modeled as a direct function of soil P availability metrics like the kinetic parameters. The product of these two independent models would provide a more mechanistically sound prediction of P-uptake. To properly test this, future experiments must include intermediate fertilization levels (P33, P66) to capture the P-responsive range and allow for non-linear modeling. By refining both the experimental protocol and the modeling strategy in this way, P desorption kinetics holds the potential to evolve into a powerful tool that provides not just a number, but a true understanding of a soil's capacity to supply phosphorus over time.
