# Introduction

## The Complexity of Phosphorus

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all known life, forming a critical part of DNA and energy-transfer molecules. In soils—where organic, mineral, and aqueous phases interface—its behavior is complex. In the presence of oxygen, P exists almost exclusively as orthophosphate ($PO_4^{3-}$) and its protonated forms ($HPO_4^{2-}$ or $H_2PO_4^{-}$), depending on the soil pH. These dissolved phosphate species are highly reactive; they are subject to adsorption onto the surfaces of clays and oxides and can precipitate with cations like calcium, iron, and aluminum to form minerals with low solubility. Consequently, while the total amount of P in a soil can be large, only a small fraction is in the soil solution at any given moment, posing a central challenge for agriculture. The efficacy of P fertilization is often low due to these rapid immobilization processes, and P lost from agricultural fields can become an environmental pollutant, disturbing P-limited aquatic ecosystems.

**Soil organic matter (SOM) adds another layer of complexity to these interactions.** Organic acids released during the decomposition of SOM can compete with phosphate for the same adsorption sites on mineral surfaces, which can increase P concentrations in the soil solution. Furthermore, humic substances can form stable complexes with cations like Al³⁺ and Fe³⁺, preventing them from precipitating phosphate and thereby enhancing its availability. The efficacy of P fertilization is often low due to these rapid and competing immobilization processes, and P lost from agricultural fields can become an environmental pollutant, disturbing P-limited aquatic ecosystems.
## From Static Measurements to Dynamic Understanding

To manage this challenge, traditional soil testing methods (e.g., Olsen-P, AAE10, CO₂-water) were developed to quantify the **size of the readily available P pool**. This static measurement is often referred to as the **"capacity factor"**. While these tests are invaluable for basic fertility assessment, they do not capture the dynamic nature of P supply. A crucial missing piece of information is the rate at which P is replenished into the soil solution from the solid phase after being taken up by plant roots. This replenishment rate, or **"kinetic factor"**, is vital for sustaining crop growth, especially during periods of high demand.

The importance of these dynamics is not a new concept. As early as 1982, **Flossmann and Richter** argued that characterizing the kinetics of P release was essential for refining fertilizer recommendations beyond what static tests alone could offer. Modern research has reinforced this view, showing that fertilization strategies based solely on maintaining a critical soil test P (STP) concentration can be inefficient. In Switzerland, this has led to the accumulation of "legacy P" in many agricultural soils, and understanding the release kinetics of this legacy P is key to both improving nutrient efficiency and protecting water quality. Furthermore, critical STP levels are not constant; they are influenced by pedoclimatic factors like soil texture and temperature, making a "one-size-fits-all" approach to fertilization suboptimal.

## Objectives and Research Questions

An ideal set of parameters for P management should meet several criteria. The parameters should correlate strongly with P export and P balance in a steady-state system. They must also respond to fertilizer inputs and, most importantly, capture the diffusive, kinetic nature of P supply to plant roots.

This thesis hypothesizes that **kinetic parameters describing P desorption, derived from a simple laboratory extraction, can serve as effective predictors for agronomic outcomes.** Using soils from the long-term STYCS experiment in Switzerland, this study employs a modified version of the Flossmann & Richter kinetic test to derive the desorption rate ($k$) and the desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$). The performance of these new kinetic parameters will be compared against standard STP methods ($P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$) by addressing the following research questions:

1.  Is the P desorption kinetic method replicable and effective for the soils from the STYCS trial?
2.  How do the kinetic coefficients, $k$ and $P^S$, correlate with key soil properties (organic carbon, clay content, pH)?
3.  How well do the standard STP methods ($P_{CO_2}$ & $P_{AAE10}$) predict crop yield, P export, and P balance?
4.  Can the kinetic parameters, $k$ and $P^S$, improve the prediction of these agronomic outcomes compared to the standard static tests?
