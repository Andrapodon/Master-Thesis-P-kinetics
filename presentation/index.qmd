## Introduction

-   In my Internship I studied the current GRUD, particularly Mg, P and K

-   Fertilizer requirement models imply $Y\sim STP + Clay$ & $P-\text{Export}\sim STP + Clay$

-   Currently only stationary measurement of STP are considered

-   Could a kinetic desorption-model better explain the soil status and yield data?


## Experimental Setup

-   LTE STYCS, all treatment conditions equal except P-fertilization, which is in 6 Levels, 3 were considered($P0$,$P100$,$P166$)
-   4 Sites regarded; Ellighausen, Rümlang-Altwi, Oensingen, Zürich-Reckenholz
-   5 Sites, 4 blocks per site, 6 Treatment-Levels, 4 Repetitions
-   Years 2022 was modelled, kinetic data was collected for year 2022

## Kinetic Model

Flossmann & Richter conducted in 1982 experiments that should:

-   improve the classification of P-supply in soils
-   work in tandem with a current STP-method e.g. CAL or Olsen

The net-desorption was observed, a kinetic of first order was assumed: $$\frac{dP}{dt}=k\times(P^S-P)$$ When solved with $P(0)=0$, the following equation was obtained: $$P(t)=P^S\times(1-e^{-kt})$$ The researchers estimated the plateau $P^S=P_\text{CAL/Olsen}-P_{H_2O}$ and linearized as follows: $$log(1-\frac{P(t)}{P^S})=-kt$$ $PS$, $k$ and $k*PS$ were extracted, $k*PS$ being the average net-release speed.

## Adapted Kinetic-Experiment Setup

## Could a kinetic desorption-model better explain the soil status and yield data?

[**Relevant Variables**]{.underline}

**Soil Variables:**

-   $P-CO_2$ & $P-AAE10$ stand for the **GRUD STP-measurements** in \[$g~P/kg ~ Soil$\]
-   $k$($s^{-1}$) can be interpreted as the **relative speed of net-desorption** of orthophosphate
-   $k*PS$($g~Ps^{-1}$) can be interpreted as the **average net-release speed**
-   $PS$($mg~P/L~H_2O$) is the **equilibrium concentration of $PO_4^{3-}$ of the net-desorption** experiment
-   From the 0-20cm Horizon: Clay-, Silt-,$C_{org}$-content and pH

**Yield Variables:**

-   For a year $X$ and crop $C$ $Y_{main-rel}$ stands for $Y_{main-rel}:=Y_C^{X}/mean(Y_C~\text{in year}~X~\text{in CH})$
-   For every year:site:crop combination the yield was normalised using: $Y_\text{norm}:=Y/median(Y_{P166})$
-   The P-Export was calculated as the **P-Uptake of the main product**
-   The P-Balance was calculated as the difference $P_{Fertilized}-\text{P-Export}$

## Research Questions

-   I: Is the **method** presented by Flossmann and Richter (1982) with the double extraction **replicable** with the soils from the **STYCS-trial**?
-   II: How do GRUD-measurements of **STP** **correlate** to the soil properties $C_\text{org}$**-content, clay-content, silt-content and pH**?
-   III: Are the kinetic coefficients $k$ **and** $PS$ **correlated to soil properties**?
-   IV: How well can current GRUD methods of **STP** ($P-CO_2$ & $P-AAE10$) **predict** the **Yield-parameters, P-Export and P-Balance**?
-   V: How well can the **kinetic parameters** $k$ & $PS$ **predict Yield-parameters, P-Export and P-Balance**?

## QI: Replicability of kinetic model in STYCS

::: notes
The estimation of the Plateau PS as proposed by Flossman und Richter was over 10 times higher than the observed concentrations in the experiment. As a consequence the linearization of the data-points did not deliver models with low $R^2$ and significant parameter estimations. To this end I took more measurements and attempted to use a non-linear-regression to simultaneously estimate PS and k. Those models were calculated for every site:treatment combination and delivered favourable predictions, although some experimantal errors or block effects were observable.

# QII & III: STP, k & PS correlate to soil properties?

::: notes
-   columns are models, rows are covariates used, cells are effects with significance
-   all but $k$ correlated to treatment
-   $k$ correlated to pH and silt
-   Plateau, P-CO2 and P-AAE10 correlated to Corg, unexpected
-   P-CO2, P-AAE10 no correlation with clay
-   P-AAE10 positive correlation to pH, surprising, should be negative
-   $k*log(PS)$ correlated to pH, silt and clay and weaker to Treatment
-   $R^2_m=0.85$ is remarkable
:::

**Observation**

-   P-CO2 and P-AAE10 did not correlate with clay-content
-   k does not correlate with Treatment but with pH and silt-content
-   $k*log(PS)$ had significant effects for clay- and silt-content as well as pH, but lower in Treatment
-   PS was the covariate best predicted by soil properties: $R^2_m=0.858$

```

::: notes
-   columns are models, rows are covariates used, cells are effects with significance
-   $R^2_m$ for Ynorm-models is notably hugher than Yrel
-   P-CO2 and P-AAE10 had significant effect separately, but not combined and no increase in $R^2_m$, although this is grud interpretation
-   Ynorm correlated to $k$ and $k*log(PS)$
-   Yrel did not show any correlation, except for P-AAE10,
-   for Yrel $R^2_c$ are very big comared to $R^2_m$, confounded information in the sites or normalize through national mean problematic?
:::

**Observation**

-   $k*log(PS)$ and $k$ showed the strongest effects in the prediction of Ynorm and Yrel
-   P-AAE10 did show a significant effect in prediction of Yrel

```

::: notes
-   columns are models, rows are covariates used, cells are effects with significance
-   P-CO2 significant alone and in combination with P-AAE10
-   $R^2_c$ seem inflated in comparison to $R^2_m$ confounded effects?
:::

**Observations**

-   P-CO2 did show strong effects in predicting Pexport

# Apply formatting

# Display with kable

      Significant codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05") |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")




```

::: notes
-   columns are models, rows are covariates used, cells are effects with significance
-   P-Balance correlates strongly to PS and $R^2_m=0.52$ is substantial compared to grud STP
:::

**Observation**

-   $PS$ showed the strongest effect in predicting P_balance and k showed substantial $R^2_m$

## Concluding Remarcs

- The net-desorption of P probably follows a first-order-kinetic, but $PS$ is difficult to directly estimate.
- The kinetic parameters $k$ and $PS$ could comparably and sometimes better explain Ynorm, Yrel and P-Balance.
- Regarding the difference between $R^2_m$ and $R^2_C$ confounded effects seem to be buried in the sites.
- P-CO2 and P-AAE10 are not as well explainable as $PS$ and $k$, in particular not by clay-content.
- P-CO2 correlated however significantly with P-Export
