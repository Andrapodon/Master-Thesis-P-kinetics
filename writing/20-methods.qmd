## The Long-Term Phosphorus Fertilization Experiment

The soil samples for this thesis originate from a set of six long-term field trials in Switzerland, established by Agroscope between 1989 and 1992. The primary objective of these experiments was to validate and re-evaluate Swiss phosphorus (P) fertilization guidelines by assessing long-term crop yield responses to varying P inputs across different pedoclimatic conditions. A detailed description of the experimental design and site characteristics can be found in Hirte et al. (2021).

The experiment was set up as a **completely randomized block design** with four field replications at each site. The core of the experiment consists of six fixed-plot treatments representing different P fertilization levels, which were applied annually as superphosphate before tillage and sowing. These levels were based on percentages of the officially recommended P inputs: 0% (Zero), 33% (Deficit), 67% (Reduced), 100% (Norm), 133% (Elevated), and 167% (Surplus).

## Experimental Sites

The six experimental sites are located in the main crop-growing regions of Switzerland: **Rümlang-Altwi (ALT)**, **Cadenazzo (CAD)**, **Ellighausen (ELL)**, **Grabs (GRA)**, **Oensingen (OEN)**, and **Zurich-Reckenholz (REC)**. The key soil properties are summarized below.

## Phosphorus Desorption Kinetics

The analysis of phosphorus (P) desorption kinetics was based on the principles of sequential extraction established by Flossmann and Richter (1982). The original method is described below, followed by the specific protocol adapted for this study.

### Original Method of Flossmann and Richter (1982)

The foundational method aims to characterize the P replenishment capacity of the soil. The procedure is as follows:

1.  **Removal of Soluble P**: 17.5 g of air-dried soil is shaken with 350 ml of deionized water for one hour at 25 ± 1°C. The suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant is decanted to remove the readily soluble P fraction. This first extract is referred to as:
    * **Solution A**: Contains easily soluble P, which is discarded.

2.  **Kinetic Extraction**: The remaining soil pellet is resuspended with another 350 ml of deionized water. Subsamples of the suspension are taken at specific time intervals, yielding the following extracts for kinetic analysis:
    * **Solution B**: Subsample taken after **10 minutes**.
    * **Solution C**: Subsample taken after **30 minutes**.
    * **Solution D**: Subsample taken after **120 minutes**.

3.  **Analysis**: The P concentration in Solutions B, C, and D is determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue method according to Murphy and Riley (1962).

### Adapted Kinetic Protocol for This Study

For this thesis, the original method was modified to capture the desorption process with a higher temporal resolution and using a different soil-to-solution ratio.

1.  **Soil Suspension**: 10 g of air-dried soil was suspended in 200 ml of deionized water. Unlike the original protocol, a pre-washing step to remove soluble P was not performed, meaning the measured desorption includes both the release of readily soluble P and the subsequent replenishment from the solid phase.

2.  **Kinetic Extraction**: The suspension was shaken continuously, and subsamples were taken at eight time points to generate a detailed kinetic curve. The resulting extracts were:
    * **Extract 1**: Subsample taken after **2 minutes**.
    * **Extract 2**: Subsample taken after **4 minutes**.
    * **Extract 3**: Subsample taken after **10 minutes**.
    * **Extract 4**: Subsample taken after **15 minutes**.
    * **Extract 5**: Subsample taken after **20 minutes**.
    * **Extract 6**: Subsample taken after **30 minutes**.
    * **Extract 7**: Subsample taken after **45 minutes**.
    * **Extract 8**: Subsample taken after **60 minutes**.

3.  **Analysis**: Each subsample was immediately filtered. The concentration of orthophosphate in the filtered extracts was determined colorimetrically using the **malachite green method**.

## Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis aimed to derive the kinetic parameters of phosphorus (P) desorption for each soil sample. A two-stage approach was employed, starting with a linearized model and progressing to a more robust non-linear mixed-effects model.

### Initial Approach: Linearized Model

[cite_start]Following the conceptual framework of Flossmann and Richter (1982), a first attempt was made to linearize the first-order kinetic model[cite: 2, 3]. The differential equation describing P release was solved and rearranged to yield a linear relationship:

$$ \log\left(1 - \frac{P(t)}{P^S}\right) = -kt $$

In this formulation, $P(t)$ is the concentration of desorbed P at time $t$, $k$ is the rate constant, and $P^S$ is the maximum desorbable P, acting as the asymptote. [cite_start]For this initial model, the $P^S$ parameter was not estimated from the kinetic data itself but was calculated *a priori* for each sample as the difference between the phosphorus concentration measured by the Olsen method ($P_\text{Olsen}$) and the initially water-soluble P concentration ($P_{H_2O}$)[cite: 3, 7].

While this approach allowed for the use of simple linear regression to estimate $k$, the reliance on an externally calculated asymptote led to poor model fits and physically unrealistic results for several samples. Consequently, this method was discarded in favor of a more direct modeling approach.

### Final Approach: Non-Linear Mixed-Effects Model

[cite_start]To overcome the limitations of the linearized model, a non-linear mixed-effects model (`nlme`) was implemented to estimate both the rate constant $k$ and the asymptote $P^S$ simultaneously and directly from the time-series data[cite: 29].

The model was fitted to the exact solution of the first-order rate equation:

$$ P(t) = P^S \times (1 - e^{-k \times t'}) $$

Here, $t'$ represents the adjusted time. [cite_start]Based on preliminary analysis, it was observed that some P dissolves rapidly before the first measurement point[cite: 25]. [cite_start]To account for this, the measured time was adjusted by adding a 3-minute offset ($t' = t_\text{min} + 3$)[cite: 7, 25].

[cite_start]The model was implemented in R using the `nlme` package[cite: 29]. To account for the hierarchical structure of the data, where multiple time points are nested within each unique soil sample, the model was specified with both fixed and random effects. The overall population means for $P^S$ and $k$ were estimated as **fixed effects**. [cite_start]To capture the unique desorption characteristics of each individual soil sample (defined by its unique ID, `uid`), subject-specific deviations from the fixed effects for both $P^S$ and $k$ were modeled as **random effects**[cite: 29].

This approach allowed for the robust estimation of individual kinetic parameters for each soil sample, providing the `k` and `P^S` coefficients used for all subsequent analyses in this thesis.
