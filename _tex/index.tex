\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{The Complexity of
Phosphorus}\label{the-complexity-of-phosphorus}

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all known life, forming
a critical part of DNA and energy-transfer molecules (Berg et al., 2019;
National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements, 2023;
Nelson et al., 2021). In soils---where organic, mineral, and aqueous
phases interface---its behavior is complex. In the presence of oxygen, P
exists almost exclusively as orthophosphate (\(PO_4^{3-}\)) and its
protonated forms (\(HPO_4^{2-}\) or \(H_2PO_4^{-}\)), depending on the
soil pH (Brady \& Weil, 2016; Sparks, 2003). These dissolved phosphate
species are highly reactive; they are subject to adsorption onto the
surfaces of clays and oxides and can precipitate with cations like
calcium, iron, and aluminum to form minerals with low solubility (Bohn
et al., 2002; Hinsinger, 2001; Sposito, 2008). Consequently, while total
soil P concentrations can be substantial, often ranging from 200 to 3000
mg kg⁻¹, the concentration of orthophosphate in the soil solution---the
form directly acquired by plant roots---is typically minuscule, often in
the range of 0.001 to 1 mg L⁻¹. This vast difference between the total
phosphorus stock and the infinitesimally small plant-available pool
represents a central challenge for global agricultural productivity
(Brady \& Weil, 2016; Holford, 1997; Sposito, 2008). This creates a
profound agronomic and environmental dilemma: while the majority of
applied P fertilizer is rapidly immobilized in the soil and remains
unavailable to crops, the fraction that is lost from fields via runoff
and erosion becomes a potent environmental pollutant. This fugitive P is
a primary driver of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems, which are
often naturally P-limited Sharpley et al. (2003).

\textbf{Soil organic matter (SOM) adds another layer of complexity to
these interactions.} Organic acids released during the decomposition of
SOM can compete with phosphate for the same adsorption sites on mineral
surfaces, which can increase P concentrations in the soil solution.
Furthermore, humic substances can form stable complexes with cations
like Al³⁺ and Fe³⁺, preventing them from precipitating phosphate and
thereby enhancing its availability (Gerke, 2010; Stevenson, 1994).

\subsection{From Static Measurements to Dynamic
Understanding}\label{from-static-measurements-to-dynamic-understanding}

To manage this challenge, soil testing methods were developed to
estimate plant-available phosphorus. These tests are designed to measure
two key components of P availability: the \textbf{intensity factor},
which is the concentration of P in the soil solution at a given moment,
and the \textbf{capacity factor}, which represents the pool of weakly
adsorbed P that can readily replenish the soil solution. Traditional
methods used in Switzerland and the surrounding DACH region, such as
extraction with CO₂-saturated water or ammonium acetate EDTA (AAE10),
are designed to estimate the size of this readily available P pool (the
capacity factor) (Forschungsanstalt für Agrarökologie und Landbau (FAL),
1996; Schofield, 1955; Verband Deutscher Landwirtschaftlicher
Untersuchungs- und Forschungsanstalten (VDLUFA), 2000).While these tests
are invaluable for basic fertility assessment, they do not capture the
dynamic nature of P supply. A crucial missing piece of information is
the rate at which P is replenished into the soil solution from the solid
phase after being taken up by plant roots. This replenishment rate, or
\textbf{``kinetic factor''}, is vital for sustaining crop growth,
especially during periods of high demand Frossard et al. (2000).

The importance of these dynamics is not a new concept. As early as 1982,
\textbf{Flossmann and Richter} argued that characterizing the kinetics
of P release was essential for refining fertilizer recommendations
beyond what static tests alone could offer (Flossmann \& Richter, 1982).
Modern research has reinforced this view, showing that fertilization
strategies based solely on maintaining a critical soil test P (STP)
concentration can be inefficient (McDowell \& Sharpley, 2001; Rowe et
al., 2016). In Switzerland, this has led to the accumulation of ``legacy
P'' in many agricultural soils, and understanding the release kinetics
of this legacy P is key to both improving nutrient efficiency and
protecting water quality (Hirte et al., 2018). Furthermore, critical STP
levels are not constant; they are influenced by pedoclimatic factors
like soil texture and temperature, making a ``one-size-fits-all''
approach to fertilization suboptimal (Bell et al., 2013; Hirte, Richner,
et al., 2021; Sims \& Sharpley, 2005).

\subsection{Objectives and Research
Questions}\label{objectives-and-research-questions}

An ideal set of parameters for phosphorus (P) management must move
beyond simple agronomic sufficiency to encompass both environmental
stewardship and the biophysical realities of nutrient acquisition by
plants. To be truly effective, such parameters must: (1) be sensitive to
changes in the soil P status resulting from fertilizer inputs and crop
removal (the P balance) (Johnston et al., 2001); (2) correlate with the
risk of P loss to the environment (P export) (Sharpley et al., 2000);
and (3), most critically, reflect the kinetic nature of P supply to
plant roots, which is governed by the slow diffusion of phosphate in the
soil solution (Kuang et al., 2012; Nye \& Tinker, 2000).

This thesis hypothesizes that kinetic parameters describing P
desorption, derived from a simple laboratory extraction, can serve as
effective predictors for agronomic outcomes. To test this, soils were
sourced from the long-term Swiss agricultural experiment STYCS (Hirte,
Stüssel, et al., 2021), which provides an ideal platform for this
research. The experiment's multi-decade history has established stable P
equilibria across a wide and deliberately created gradient of P
availability (from 0\% to 167\% of recommended fertilization). This
allows for robust modeling of crop responses. Furthermore, the trial
encompasses six sites with diverse pedoclimatic conditions, ensuring
that any findings have broad applicability across different Swiss
agricultural landscapes. This study employs a modified version of the
Flossmann \& Richter kinetic test to derive the desorption rate (k) and
the desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)). The performance of these new
kinetic parameters will be compared against standard STP methods
(\(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\)) by addressing the following research
questions:

\subsubsection{Research Questions and
Hypotheses}\label{research-questions-and-hypotheses}

\paragraph{Research Question 1: How well do standard soil test P (STP)
methods predict agronomic outcomes and how do they relate to fundamental
soil
properties?}\label{research-question-1-how-well-do-standard-soil-test-p-stp-methods-predict-agronomic-outcomes-and-how-do-they-relate-to-fundamental-soil-properties}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 1a (Agronomic Performance):} The standard STP
  methods (\(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\)), which measure the P
  \emph{capacity} (the size of the readily available pool), will show a
  significant correlation with the P-Balance, as this is directly
  influenced by P inputs (Johnston et al., 2001). However, they will be
  weak predictors of relative crop yield and P-uptake, as these
  agronomic outcomes are more dependent on the \emph{rate} of P supply
  throughout the growing season (Hirte, Stüssel, et al., 2021).
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 1b (Relation to Soil Properties):} The measured STP
  values will be positively correlated with soil clay and organic carbon
  content, reflecting the greater number of sorption sites in these
  soils (Brady \& Weil, 2016). Conversely, the P\_AAE10 measurement will
  be negatively correlated with soil pH, particularly in soils with a
  \(pH > 6.8\), due to the chelation of \(Ca^{2+}\) and \(Mg^{2+}\) by
  the EDTA in the extractant, which reduces its effectiveness
  (Forschungsanstalt für Agrarökologie und Landbau (FAL), 1996).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Research Question 2: Can P desorption kinetics be reliably
characterized for the diverse soils of the STYCS trial, and how do the
derived kinetic parameters relate to soil
properties?}\label{research-question-2-can-p-desorption-kinetics-be-reliably-characterized-for-the-diverse-soils-of-the-stycs-trial-and-how-do-the-derived-kinetic-parameters-relate-to-soil-properties}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 2a (Methodological Feasibility):} The P desorption
  process in the STYCS soils will follow a first-order kinetic model.
  However, the original linear estimation method proposed by Flossmann
  \& Richter (1982) may be inaccurate because it relies on a potentially
  overestimated desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)). A non-linear
  modeling approach will provide more robust and replicable estimates of
  both the desorption rate constant (\emph{k}) and the desorbable P pool
  (\(P_{desorb}\)) (Kuang et al., 2012).
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 2b (Relation to Soil Properties):} The kinetic
  parameters will be significantly influenced by soil composition. The
  desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)) is expected to correlate positively
  with clay and organic matter content, which provide sorption surfaces.
  The rate constant (\emph{k}) is expected to be influenced by pH, as
  the speciation of orthophosphate changes, affecting its interaction
  with mineral surfaces and its mobility (Sparks, 2003).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Research Question 3: Can kinetic parameters significantly
improve the prediction of agronomic outcomes compared to standard static
STP
methods?}\label{research-question-3-can-kinetic-parameters-significantly-improve-the-prediction-of-agronomic-outcomes-compared-to-standard-static-stp-methods}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hypothesis 3 (Improved Predictive Power):} Because plant P
  uptake is fundamentally limited by the slow diffusion of phosphate to
  the root surface, a dynamic measure is required for accurate
  prediction (Nye \& Tinker, 2000). Therefore, a model incorporating the
  kinetic parameters (\emph{k} and \(P_{desorb}\)), which together
  describe the replenishment rate of the soil solution, will explain a
  significantly greater proportion of the variance in relative yield and
  P-uptake compared to models based solely on the static STP
  measurements (Fardeau et al., 1991; Frossard et al., 2000).
\end{itemize}

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec-materials-and-methods}

\subsection{The Long-Term Phosphorus Fertilization
Experiment}\label{sec-the-long-term-phosphorus-fertilization-experiment}

The soil samples for this thesis originate from a set of six long-term
field trials in Switzerland, established by Agroscope between 1989 and
1992. The primary objective of these experiments was to validate and
re-evaluate Swiss phosphorus (P) fertilization guidelines by assessing
long-term crop yield responses to varying P inputs across different
pedoclimatic conditions. A detailed description of the experimental
design and site characteristics can be found in Hirte, Richner, et al.
(2021).

The experiment was set up as a \textbf{completely randomized block
design} with four field replications at each site. The core of the
experiment consists of six fixed-plot treatments representing different
P fertilization levels, which were applied annually as superphosphate
before tillage and sowing. These levels were based on percentages of the
officially recommended P inputs: 0\% (Zero), 33\% (Deficit), 67\%
(Reduced), 100\% (Norm), 133\% (Elevated), and 167\% (Surplus).

\subsection{Experimental Sites}\label{sec-experimental-sites}

The six experimental sites are located in the main crop-growing regions
of Switzerland: \textbf{Rümlang-Altwi (ALT)}, \textbf{Cadenazzo (CAD)},
\textbf{Ellighausen (ELL)}, \textbf{Grabs (GRA)}, \textbf{Oensingen
(OEN)}, and \textbf{Zurich-Reckenholz (REC)}. The key soil properties
are summarized below.

\subsection{Phosphorus Desorption
Kinetics}\label{sec-phosphorus-desorption-kinetics}

The analysis of phosphorus (P) desorption kinetics was based on the
principles of sequential extraction established by (Flossmann \&
Richter, 1982). The original method is described below, followed by the
specific protocol adapted for this study.

\subsubsection{Original Method of Flossmann and Richter
(1982)}\label{original-method-of-flossmann-and-richter-1982}

The foundational method aims to characterize the P replenishment
capacity of the soil. The procedure is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Removal of Soluble P}: 17.5 g of air-dried soil is shaken with
  350 ml of deionized water for one hour at 120 Hz in a horizontal
  soil-shaker. The suspension is centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes
  and the supernatant is decanted to remove the readily soluble P
  fraction.
\item
  \textbf{Kinetic Extraction}: The remaining soil pellet is resuspended
  with another 350 ml of deionized water. Subsamples of the suspension
  are taken at specific time intervals (e.g., 10, 30, and 120 minutes).
\item
  \textbf{Analysis}: The P concentration in the subsamples is determined
  colorimetrically.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Adapted Kinetic Protocol for This
Study}\label{sec-adapted-kinetic-protocol-for-this-study}

For this thesis, the original method was modified to capture the
desorption process with a higher temporal resolution.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Pre-washing to Remove Soluble P}: A pre-washing step was
  performed to remove the readily soluble P fraction. 10 g of air-dried
  soil was suspended in 200 ml of deionized water and shaken for 60
  minutes at 120 Hz. The suspension was then centrifuged for 15 minutes
  at 4000 rpm, and the supernatant containing the soluble P was
  discarded.
\item
  \textbf{Kinetic Extraction}: The remaining soil pellet was resuspended
  in 200 ml of fresh deionized water. The suspension was shaken
  continuously, and subsamples were taken at eight time points to
  generate a detailed kinetic curve: \textbf{2, 4, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45,
  and 60 minutes}.
\item
  \textbf{Analysis}: Each subsample was immediately filtered. The
  concentration of orthophosphate in the filtered extracts was
  determined colorimetrically using the \textbf{malachite green method}
  (Van Veldhoven \& Mannaerts, 1987).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{sec-statistical-analysis}

\subsubsection{Software and Statistical
Environment}\label{software-and-statistical-environment}

All data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization were
conducted using the R programming language (v. 4.2.2) (R Core Team,
2022). The primary packages used for the analysis were: - \texttt{nlme}
(Pinheiro et al., 2022) for fitting the non-linear mixed-effects models
to the kinetic data. - \texttt{lme4} (Bates et al., 2015) and
\texttt{lmerTest} (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) for fitting and testing the
linear mixed-effects models for agronomic and soil property analyses. -
\texttt{mlr3} (Lang et al., 2019) for the systematic feature selection
and model validation workflow.

\subsubsection{Modeling of Desorption
Kinetics}\label{sec-modeling-of-desorption-kinetics}

To derive the kinetic parameters, a non-linear mixed-effects model was
implemented using the \texttt{nlme} package. This approach was chosen to
simultaneously estimate the rate constant (\emph{k}) and the maximum
desorbable P (\(P_{desorb}\)) for each soil sample. The model was fitted
to the exact solution of the first-order rate equation:

\[P(t) = P_{desorb} \times (1 - e^{-k \times t'})\]

Where \(P(t)\) is the P concentration at time \(t\), and \(t'\) is an
adjusted time (\(t_{min}\) + 3 min) to account for the rapid initial
dissolution of P that occurs before the first measurement. In this
mixed-effects framework, the overall mean values for \(P_{desorb}\) and
\emph{k} were modeled as \textbf{fixed effects}, while sample-specific
deviations from these fixed effects were modeled as \textbf{random
effects} to capture the unique desorption characteristics of each
individual soil sample.

\subsubsection{Comparative Modeling of Soil and Agronomic
Parameters}\label{comparative-modeling-of-soil-and-agronomic-parameters}

To test the hypotheses of this thesis, two distinct sets of linear
mixed-effects models were constructed.

\subsubsection{Model Assumptions and
Diagnostics}\label{model-assumptions-and-diagnostics}

The validity of the linear mixed-effects models (\texttt{lmer}) relies
on several key assumptions, primarily that the model residuals are
normally distributed and homoscedastic (i.e., have constant variance
across the range of predicted values). Prior to finalizing the models,
these assumptions were rigorously checked through visual inspection of
diagnostic plots, such as quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of the residuals
and plots of residuals versus fitted values.

Initial exploratory data analysis revealed that several of the predictor
variables, most notably the desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\) or PS),
were strongly right-skewed. Using such variables directly in the linear
models would violate the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity,
leading to potentially biased and unreliable coefficient estimates.

To address this, various transformations (including square root and
logarithmic) were tested on the skewed variables. The natural
log-transformation (\texttt{log()}) was found to be the most effective
at normalizing the distribution of \texttt{PS} and producing
well-behaved model residuals that more closely met the required
assumptions. Therefore, \texttt{log(PS)} was used as a fixed effect in
all subsequent agronomic models to ensure the statistical validity of
the results.

\paragraph{Models of P Availability Metrics as a Function of Soil
Properties}\label{models-of-p-availability-metrics-as-a-function-of-soil-properties}

First, to investigate the underlying soil-chemical drivers of the
different P availability metrics (both kinetic and static), a series of
models was built to predict each metric from key soil properties.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Fixed Effects Structure:} The fixed effects were identical for
  all models in this category and included the primary soil physical and
  chemical properties: clay content, silt content, pH, organic carbon
  content, and dithionite-extractable iron (\(Fe_d\)) and aluminum
  (\(Al_d\)).
\item
  \textbf{Random Effects Structure:} The random effects structure
  accounted for the nested design of the STYCS experiment, with random
  intercepts for \texttt{year}, \texttt{Site}, \texttt{Site:block}, and
  \texttt{Site:Treatment}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Comparative Models of Agronomic
Outcomes}\label{comparative-models-of-agronomic-outcomes}

Second, the predictive power of the kinetic parameters was directly
compared against that of the standard STP methods (``GRUD'' system). For
each agronomic response variable (Normalized Yield, P Uptake, and P
Balance), two competing models were built. These models shared an
identical random effects structure to ensure a fair comparison,
differing only in their fixed effects.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Random Effects Structure (for all agronomic models):} The
  structure
  \texttt{(1\textbar{}year)\ +\ (1\textbar{}Site)\ +\ (1\textbar{}Site:block)}
  was used to control for variations due to the growing season,
  location, and in-field spatial differences.
\item
  \textbf{Model 1: The Kinetic Approach}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Fixed Effects:} This model used the kinetic parameters and
    their interaction: \texttt{k\ *\ log(PS)}. The interaction term
    tests the hypothesis that the benefit of a large desorbable P pool
    (\texttt{PS}) depends on the \emph{rate} (\texttt{k}) at which it
    can be accessed.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Model 2: The Standard STP (GRUD) Approach}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Fixed Effects:} This model used the two standard Swiss soil
    tests and their interaction: \texttt{P\_CO2\ *\ P\_AAE10}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The relative performance of these two sets of models was then evaluated
to determine whether the kinetic parameters provided a significant
improvement in predictive power for key agronomic outcomes. Further the
relative performance of these two approaches, along with other
combinations of predictor sets, was rigorously evaluated using a machine
learning benchmark workflow implemented in the \texttt{mlr3} package
(Lang et al., 2019). The predictive power of each predictor set was
quantified using \textbf{5-fold cross-validation}. Performance was
measured as the percentage of explained variance on the hold-out data (1
- MSE / Var(y)), providing a robust and unbiased estimate of how well
each model would generalize to new data. This benchmark allowed for a
direct comparison of the information content provided by the kinetic
parameters versus the standard soil tests for predicting key agronomic
outcomes.

\section{Results}\label{results}

The results of this study are presented in two main parts. First, the
development and validation of the phosphorus (P) desorption kinetic
model are detailed, justifying the final modeling approach. Second, the
descriptive trends of both agronomic outcomes and soil P parameters in
response to long-term fertilization and site differences are explored
visually. Finally, the predictive power of the kinetic and standard P
parameters is formally evaluated using linear mixed-effects models.

\subsection{Establishment of the P-Desorption Kinetic
Model}\label{establishment-of-the-p-desorption-kinetic-model}

The primary goal was to derive two key parameters for each soil sample:
the desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)) and the rate constant (\(k\)).
The analysis proceeded in two stages: an initial test of a linearized
model, followed by the implementation of a more robust non-linear model.

\subsubsection{Initial Approach: Failure of the Linearized
Model}\label{initial-approach-failure-of-the-linearized-model}

Following the conceptual framework of Flossmann and Richter (1982), the
first-order kinetic equation was linearized. A core assumption of this
model is that the linear relationship must pass through the origin. To
test this, linear models were fitted to the transformed data for each
sample individually. The results revealed a systematic failure of this
assumption, as the estimated intercepts for the majority of samples were
highly significantly different from zero (p \textless{} 0.05). This
consistent statistical deviation indicated that the linearized approach
was not a valid representation of the data. The visual evidence in
Figure~\ref{fig-linearized-model} supports this conclusion.

}

\caption{\label{fig-linearized-model}Test of the linearized first-order
kinetic model. The plot visually supports the statistical finding that
many intercepts are not zero.}

\end{figure}%

\subsubsection{Final Approach: Successful Non-Linear
Model}\label{final-approach-successful-non-linear-model}

Given the statistical failure of the linearized model, a direct
non-linear modeling approach was adopted to estimate both \(P_{desorb}\)
and \(k\) simultaneously from the untransformed data. This approach does
not rely on the assumption of a zero intercept and proved to be far more
successful, accurately capturing the curvilinear shape of the desorption
data for nearly all samples (fig-nonlinear-model). The final parameters
were extracted from a non-linear mixed-effects model (\texttt{nlme}) to
account for the hierarchical data structure. \textbf{These final
\texttt{nlme}-derived coefficients were used for all subsequent
analyses.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Comparison with Isotopic Exchange Kinetics
(IEK)}\label{comparison-with-isotopic-exchange-kinetics-iek}

To validate the newly derived kinetic parameters against an established
benchmark, the capacity (\(P_{desorb}\)) and kinetic (\(k\)) parameters
were compared to data from Isotopic Exchange Kinetics (IEK) studies
previously conducted on the same long-term trial sites by Demaria et
al.~(2013). This comparison aims to determine if the simpler,
non-equilibrium desorption method used in this thesis captures similar
aspects of soil P dynamics as the more complex, equilibrium-based IEK
method.

The size of the desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)) was compared against
the long-term isotopically exchangeable P pool measured after 7 days
(\(E_{7d}\)). The desorption rate constant (\(k\)) was compared against
the IEK kinetic parameter measured after 24 hours (\(n_{1d}\)).
Spearman's rank correlation was used to robustly test for monotonic
trends between the different methods.

\end{figure}%

The analysis revealed a statistically significant, moderate positive
correlation between the capacity parameters, \(P_{desorb}\) and
\(E_{7d}\) (fig-iek-comparison). The Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient was 0.4 with a p-value of \textless{} 0.001.

Similarly, a statistically significant, moderate positive correlation
was found between the kinetic parameters, \(k\) and \(n_{1d}\)
(fig-iek-comparison). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was
0.36 with a p-value of \textless{} 0.001.

These results indicate that the simpler, non-equilibrium desorption
method used in this study successfully captures both the capacity and
intensity aspects of soil P lability, providing results that are
consistent with the more complex, equilibrium-based IEK method reported
by Demaria et al.~(2013).

\subsection{Effects of Fertilization on Agronomic and Soil
Parameters}\label{sec-effects-of-fertilization-on-agronomic-and-soil-parameters}

Having established a robust method to determine the kinetic parameters,
the next step was to explore the effects of the long-term P
fertilization treatments on both the agronomic outcomes and the soil P
test parameters.

\subsubsection{Agronomic Responses to P
Fertilization}\label{sec-agronomic-responses-to-p-fertilization}

The long-term application of different P fertilization levels had a
pronounced impact on the primary agronomic outcomes, including two
different metrics for yield, P Uptake (\(P_{up}\)), and P Balance
(\(P_{bal}\)), though the response varied considerably between sites
(Figure~\ref{fig-agronomic-responses}).

\phantomsection\label{cell-fig-agronomic-responses}
\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{index_files/figure-pdf/fig-agronomic-responses-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-agronomic-responses}Agronomic response variables
across six P fertilization treatments and six experimental sites. Data
from 2017-2022.}

\end{figure}%

\textbf{Yield Metrics (\(Y_{norm}\) and \(Y_{rel}\))}: Both yield
metrics showed a generally positive response to P fertilization. The
site-normalized yield (\(Y_{norm}\)) shows the response relative to the
site's potential for that year, with most yields plateauing around the
Norm (100\%) treatment. The national-normalized yield (\(Y_{rel}\))
provides a broader context, showing how yields at each site compare to
the national average.

\textbf{P Uptake (\(P_{up}\))}: P uptake by crops followed a similar
trend to yield, increasing with fertilization, often continuing to
increase at the highest fertilization levels, suggesting luxury
consumption.

\textbf{P Balance (\(P_{bal}\))}: The P balance showed a strong, linear
relationship with fertilization. The Zero and Deficit treatments
resulted in a negative balance (mining soil P), while the Elevated and
Surplus treatments led to a significant P surplus.

\subsubsection{Soil P Parameters as a Function of P
Fertilization}\label{sec-soil-p-parameters-as-a-function-of-p-fertilization}

The different soil P test parameters, including the standard STP methods
and the newly derived kinetic parameters, all responded to the long-term
fertilization treatments (Figure~\ref{fig-soil-parameters}).

\phantomsection\label{cell-fig-soil-parameters}
\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{index_files/figure-pdf/fig-soil-parameters-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-soil-parameters}Soil P parameters across six P
fertilization treatments and six experimental sites.}

\end{figure}%

\textbf{Standard STPs (}\(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\)): Both standard
soil P tests showed a clear and consistent increase with rising P
fertilization levels across all sites, confirming their sensitivity to
management.

\textbf{Kinetic Parameters (}\(k\), \(P_{desorb}\), and \(J_0\)):
\textbf{Desorbable P (\(P_{desorb}\))}: This parameter behaved very
similarly to the standard STPs, increasing steadily with P fertilization
and confirming its role as a ``capacity'' indicator.\\
\textbf{Rate Constant (\(k\))}: The rate constant showed a more complex
pattern, with no strong, consistent trend with fertilization. This
suggests that while fertilization increases the \emph{amount} of
available P, it may not change the intrinsic \emph{release rate}.
\textbf{Initial P Flux (\(J_0\))}: As the product of \(P_{desorb}\) and
\(k\), this parameter integrates both capacity and intensity. It showed
a strong positive response to fertilization, driven primarily by the
increase in \(P_{desorb}\).

These initial observations suggest that the kinetic parameters,
particularly the rate constant \(k\), may provide unique information
about the soil's P dynamics not captured by static tests alone. The next
section will use formal statistical models to test these relationships.

\subsection{Predicting P Parameters from Soil
Properties}\label{sec-p-params-soil-props}

To understand the underlying drivers of the standard and kinetic P
parameters, and to test \textbf{Hypotheses 1b and 2b}, a series of
linear mixed-effects models were fitted. Each model predicted one of the
P parameters based on the core soil properties: organic carbon
(\(C_{org}\)), clay content, silt content, pH, and
dithionite-extractable Al (\(Al_d\)) and Fe (\(Fe_d\)). The results are
summarized in Table~\ref{tbl-soil-prop-models}.

\end{longtable}

The analysis reveals that the capacity-based P pools and the kinetic
rate constant are controlled by different sets of soil properties,
strongly supporting the hypotheses.

In line with \textbf{Hypothesis 2b}, the kinetic capacity parameter,
\textbf{Desorbable P (\(P_{desorb}\))}, showed a highly significant
negative relationship with both dithionite-extractable iron (\(Fe_d\))
and aluminum (\(Al_d\)). This provides strong evidence that the total
pool of free oxides, which represent the primary P sorption surfaces in
the soil, is a key factor controlling the size of the readily desorbable
P pool.

Also confirming \textbf{Hypothesis 2b}, the \textbf{Rate Constant
(\emph{k})} was governed by a different set of properties. It was not
significantly influenced by the free oxides but instead showed a
significant negative relationship with \texttt{Clay} content and a
positive relationship with organic carbon (\(C_{org}\)). This clearly
distinguishes the kinetic component from the capacity component,
suggesting that while oxides control \emph{how much} P can be held, soil
texture and organic matter influence \emph{how fast} it can be released.

The standard STP methods showed patterns consistent with
\textbf{Hypothesis 1b}. \textbf{Organic Carbon (\(C_{org}\))} had a
highly significant positive effect on \(P_{AAE10}\), and \textbf{pH} had
a significant negative effect, as predicted. The relationship of the STP
measures with the dithionite-extractable oxides was less consistent than
that of \(P_{desorb}\), with only \(P_{AAE10}\) showing a significant
negative link to \(Al_d\).

\subsection{Predictive Modeling of Agronomic
Outcomes}\label{sec-agronomic-modeling}

To formally evaluate the predictive power of the standard STP methods
against the kinetic parameters, a series of linear mixed-effects models
were fitted for each of the primary agronomic response variables. To
test the central hypotheses of this thesis, the predictive power of the
kinetic parameters was directly compared against that of the standard
STP methods for several key agronomic outcomes. For each response
variable---Normalized Yield (\(Y_{rel}\)), P Uptake (\(P_{up}\)), and P
Balance (\(P_{bal}\))---a set of competing linear mixed-effects models
was constructed.

To ensure a fair comparison, all models shared an identical random
effects structure
(\texttt{(1\textbar{}year)\ +\ (1\textbar{}Site)\ +\ (1\textbar{}Site:block)}),
differing only in their fixed effects. Four distinct models were
evaluated: \textbf{\(P_{CO_2}\) Model:} Used the standard water-soluble
P test as the sole predictor. \textbf{\(P_{AAE10}\) Model:} Used the
standard chelate-extractable P test as the sole predictor. \textbf{STP
Interaction Model:} Included both standard tests and their interaction
term (\(P_{CO_2} * P_{AAE10}\)) to capture their combined effect.
\textbf{Kinetic Model:} Used the log-transformed desorbable P pool
(\(log(P_{desorb})\)), the rate constant (\emph{k}), and their
interaction (\(J_0\)) as predictors.

The performance of these models for each agronomic outcome is presented
in the following sections.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Predicting Site-Normalized Yield
(\(Y_{norm}\))}{Predicting Site-Normalized Yield (Y\_\{norm\})}}\label{predicting-site-normalized-yield-y_norm}

The analysis reveals a clear and striking difference between the
predictive power of the standard STP methods and the kinetic parameters
for site-normalized yield.

\(R^2_c\) & 0.358 & 0.474 & 0.365 & 0.360 \\

\end{longtable}

The standard STP methods were highly effective predictors. Both the
\(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\) models showed highly significant
coefficients and explained a substantial portion of the variance, with
marginal \(R^2\) values of 0.218 and 0.198, respectively. The combined
model (STP-interaction) performed best overall, explaining 22\% of the
variance fixed effects. These results directly contradict
\textbf{Hypothesis 1a}, which posited that these static measurements
would be weak predictors of yield. For predicting yield relative to a
site's own maximum potential, the standard soil tests perform very well.

In stark contrast, the kinetic model had virtually no predictive power
for \(Y_{norm}\). The model's marginal \(R^2\) was only 0.014, and none
of the kinetic parameters---neither the rate constant (\emph{k}), the
desorbable pool (\(P_{desorb}\)), nor their interaction were
statistically significant. This finding strongly refutes
\textbf{Hypothesis 3} for this specific yield metric. The results
suggest that when agronomic potential is evaluated within a single site
(the function of site-normalization), the rate of P supply is not the
limiting factor; rather, the overall capacity or size of the available P
pool, as measured effectively by standard soil tests, is the dominant
driver of the yield response.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Predicting National-Normalized Yield
(\(Y_{rel}\))}{Predicting National-Normalized Yield (Y\_\{rel\})}}\label{predicting-national-normalized-yield-y_rel}

The models predicting national-normalized yield (\(Y_{rel}\)) reveal
that both standard and kinetic soil phosphorus tests struggle to explain
the variance in crop yields on their own, though standard tests show
slightly better performance in this context.

\paragraph{Performance of Standard STP
Methods}\label{performance-of-standard-stp-methods}

The models based on standard soil tests (\(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\))
individually showed a significant, positive relationship with relative
yield. When considered alone, both \(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\) were
significant predictors, explaining 7.4\% and 6.3\% of the variance in
yield, respectively (indicated by their marginal \(R^2\), \(R^2_m\)).
The model including their interaction term (\(P_{CO_2}*P_{AAE10}\))
performed slightly better, explaining 7.8\% of the variance.

These findings partially align with \textbf{Hypothesis 1a}, which
posited that standard STP methods would be weak predictors of relative
crop yield. The low marginal \(R^2\) values confirm that these static
measurements account for less than 8\% of the yield variation, which is
indeed a weak predictive performance.

\paragraph{Performance of the Kinetic
Model}\label{performance-of-the-kinetic-model}

Contrary to expectations, the model based on kinetic parameters
(\(k * P_{desorb}\)) demonstrated very low predictive power, with a
marginal \(R^2\) of just 2.2\%. Although the desorption rate (\(k\)) and
the initial P flux (\(J_0\)) showed a significant positive relationship
with yield, the overall model performed worse than the standard STP
methods.

This result directly contradicts \textbf{Hypothesis 3}, which stated
that a model incorporating kinetic parameters would explain a
significantly greater proportion of the variance in relative yield
compared to static STP measurements. For predicting national-normalized
yield, the opposite appears to be true; the standard methods, while
weak, still outperform the kinetic approach.

\paragraph{The Role of Unmeasured
Factors}\label{the-role-of-unmeasured-factors}

A critical observation across all models is the large discrepancy
between the marginal \(R^2\) (\(R^2_m\)) and the conditional \(R^2\)
(\(R^2_c\)). The conditional \(R^2\) represents the total variance
explained by both the fixed effects (the predictors like \(P_{CO_2}\) or
\emph{k}) and the random effects (such as \texttt{Site} and
\texttt{year}).

For instance, in the best-performing STP model (STP-interaction), the
marginal \(R^2\) is only 0.078, but the conditional \(R^2\) is 0.596.
This means that while the soil P measurements themselves explain about
8\% of the yield variance, the combination of soil tests \emph{plus} the
site- and year-specific conditions explains nearly 60\% of it. This
pattern holds for all models and strongly suggests that pedoclimatic
factors, captured by the \texttt{Site} and \texttt{year} random effects,
are the dominant drivers of crop yield in this dataset, overshadowing
the influence of the measured soil P parameters.

When predicting P-uptake, both the standard and kinetic models

\paragraph{Performance of Standard STP
Methods}\label{performance-of-standard-stp-methods-1}

The standard soil tests, \(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\), when modeled
individually, were significant positive predictors of P-uptake. The
\(P_{AAE10}\) model performed slightly better, explaining 7.3\% of the
variance (\(R^2_m\) = 0.073) compared to the \(P_{CO_2}\) model's 6.4\%
(\(R^2_m\) = 0.064). Interestingly, the interaction model did not
improve but slightly decreased the explained variance (\(R^2_m\) =
0.065), and the individual predictors lost their significance.

These results are consistent with \textbf{Hypothesis 1a}, which
predicted that standard STP methods would be weak predictors of
agronomic outcomes like P-uptake. The low marginal \(R^2\) values
confirm that these static tests, while statistically significant on
their own, account for a very small fraction of the variability in
P-uptake by crops.

\paragraph{Performance of the Kinetic
Model}\label{performance-of-the-kinetic-model-1}

The kinetic model performed on par with the standard individual tests,
explaining 6.4\% of the variance in P-uptake (\(R^2_m\) = 0.064).
However, none of the kinetic parameters (\emph{k}, \(P_{desorb}\), or
\(J_0\)) emerged as individually significant predictors.

This finding challenges \textbf{Hypothesis 3}, which anticipated that
the kinetic parameters would offer significantly improved predictive
power. For P-uptake, the kinetic model shows no advantage over the
simpler, traditional STP methods. The dynamic measures of P supply do
not appear to capture the mechanisms driving P-uptake any better than
the static measures in this context.

\paragraph{Dominance of Site and Year
Effects}\label{dominance-of-site-and-year-effects}

As with the yield predictions, there is a vast difference between the
marginal \(R^2\) and conditional \(R^2\) values across all P-uptake
models. For example, the kinetic model's marginal \(R^2\) is only 0.064,
but its conditional \(R^2\) is 0.648. This indicates that the fixed
effects (the soil P measurements) explain about 6\% of the variance,
while the random effects (\texttt{Site} and \texttt{year}) account for
the vast majority of the explained variance (around 58\%). This again
underscores that site-specific pedoclimatic conditions and year-to-year
environmental variations are the primary factors controlling P-uptake,
with the specific soil P status playing a minor, secondary role

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Predicting P-Balance

decisive contrast between the kinetic and standard STP approaches,
providing the strongest evidence in favor of the kinetic methodology.

\paragraph{Performance of the Kinetic
Model}\label{performance-of-the-kinetic-model-2}

The kinetic model emerged as an exceptionally strong predictor of the
P-Balance, explaining 57.2\% of the variance (\(R^2_m\) = 0.572). The
desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)) was a highly significant predictor (p
\textless{} 0.001). This result provides powerful support for the
underlying premise of this thesis. The P-Balance represents the net
result of P inputs and outputs over time, and the fact that
\(P_{desorb}\)---a measure of the readily available P pool---so
accurately reflects this balance is a significant finding.

This strongly supports \textbf{Hypothesis 3}, which asserted that
kinetic parameters would be more effective predictors than static tests.
In the case of P-Balance, the kinetic model is not just an improvement;
it is the only effective model.

\paragraph{Performance of Standard STP
Methods}\label{performance-of-standard-stp-methods-2}

In stark contrast, all models based on the standard STP methods
(\(P_{CO_2}\), \(P_{AAE10}\), and their interaction) completely failed
to predict the P-Balance. Their marginal \(R^2\) values were effectively
zero (\(R^2_m\) = 0.001), indicating they have no predictive power
whatsoever for this crucial agronomic metric. None of the STP predictors
were statistically significant.

This finding directly contradicts \textbf{Hypothesis 1a}, which
anticipated a significant correlation between the standard STP methods
and the P-Balance. The results show no such relationship exists,
suggesting that these static measurements do not adequately reflect the
long-term phosphorus status of the soil as represented by the P-Balance.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Interpreting the \(R^2\)
Discrepancy}{Interpreting the R\^{}2 Discrepancy}}\label{interpreting-the-r2-discrepancy}

The dramatic difference in performance is clear from the \(R^2\) values.
While the conditional \(R^2\) for the STP models is high (around 0.81),
their marginal \(R^2\) is 0.001. This indicates that all the explanatory
power comes from the random effects (\texttt{Site} and \texttt{year}),
and the STP measurements themselves contribute nothing. The kinetic
model, however, has both a high marginal \(R^2\) (0.572) and a high
conditional \(R^2\) (0.744). This demonstrates that the kinetic
parameters are themselves powerful predictors, capturing a large portion
of the variance that is independent of site and year effects.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This study aimed to determine if dynamic P desorption parameters could
provide a more accurate prediction of agronomic outcomes than
traditional static soil tests. The results reveal a complex story: the
ideal P testing method is not universal but is instead contingent on the
specific question being addressed, whether it is optimizing yield within
a single field, comparing productivity across different regions, or
managing long-term nutrient budgets.

\subsection{Hypothesis 1: The Nuanced Role of Standard Soil
Tests}\label{hypothesis-1-the-nuanced-role-of-standard-soil-tests}

\textbf{Hypothesis 1a} posited that standard STP methods (\(P_{CO_2}\)
and \(P_{AAE10}\)) would correlate with the P-Balance but be weak
predictors of crop yield. The findings challenge this hypothesis in two
unexpected ways.

First, the STP methods \textbf{failed completely to predict the
P-Balance}. The models showed no relationship between these static tests
and the long-term nutrient surplus or deficit, directly contradicting
our hypothesis. This is a critical finding, as it suggests that while
tests like \(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\) are sensitive to short-term
changes from annual fertilization, they do not adequately capture the
cumulative, long-term P status of the soil system.

Second, the performance of STP methods in predicting yield was highly
context-dependent. When predicting \textbf{site-normalized yield
(}\(Y_{norm}\)), which assesses the yield response relative to a site's
own potential, the STP models were remarkably effective, explaining up
to 22\% of the variance. This result contradicts the part of our
hypothesis that expected weak performance and suggests that for
\emph{within-field} management, where the goal is to ensure P is not
limiting relative to that specific environment's potential, traditional
capacity-based tests are well-suited and robust.

However, when predicting \textbf{national-normalized yield
(}\(Y_{rel}\)) and \textbf{P-uptake (}\(P_{up}\)), the STP models
performed poorly, aligning with our initial expectations. The weak
performance in predicting yield and P-uptake can likely be attributed to
several factors. Firstly, crop yield in field settings is often
co-limited by multiple factors beyond phosphorus. Year-to-year
variations in climate, such as solar radiation and water availability,
as well as the supply of other key nutrients like nitrogen, can become
the primary drivers of productivity, masking the more subtle influence
of soil P status (Sadras, 2002; Sinclair, 1998). The large gap between
the marginal and conditional \(R^2\) in our models strongly suggests
that these site- and year-specific variables, captured by the random
effects, were indeed the dominant factors.

Furthermore, response variables like \(P_{up}\) and \(P_{bal}\) are
calculated as the product of yield and P concentration, which can
introduce and propagate measurement uncertainty. If yield itself is only
weakly correlated with soil P status, this ``noise'' is carried into the
derived variables, making it even more difficult to establish a clear
statistical relationship (Rowe et al., 2016).

The predictive weakness may also stem from the experimental design and
modeling approach. This study utilized samples primarily from the
P-deficient (0\%) and P-sufficient (100\% and 167\%) treatments. Crop
yield response to fertilizer typically follows a saturation curve, and
it is possible that our dataset was concentrated on the less responsive
parts of this curve, thus lacking statistical power in the most dynamic
range (Schlesinger, 2009). While our use of a linear mixed-effects model
was appropriate for the available data, it cannot capture the
diminishing returns characteristic of crop nutrient response. As
demonstrated by \textbf{Hirte et al.~(2021)} on these same STYCS trials,
non-linear models like the Mitscherlich equation are better suited for
describing such saturation kinetics but would require data from the
intermediate fertilization levels to be applied robustly (Hirte,
Stüssel, et al., 2021).

Regarding \textbf{Hypothesis 1b}, the findings were largely supportive.
The analysis of soil properties confirmed that STP measurements are not
pure measures of P but are instead complex indices reflecting a
combination of P status and overarching soil chemistry. The predicted
negative relationship between \textbf{pH} and \textbf{\(P_{AAE10}\)} was
observed, and the underlying chemical mechanisms for this are
well-established, particularly in calcareous or high-pH soils like
several in this study (e.g., ALT, GRA).

The AAE10 method relies on two key components: ammonium acetate as a
buffer and EDTA as a chelating agent to dissolve mineral-bound P.
However, its effectiveness is compromised in soils with high pH and an
abundance of free calcium (\(Ca^{2+}\)) and magnesium (\(Mg^{2+}\))
cations, often from calcium carbonates (\(CaCO_3\)). There are two
primary reasons for this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Consumption of EDTA:} The primary role of EDTA is to bind to
  cations like iron and aluminum that precipitate phosphate, thereby
  releasing P into the solution. However, EDTA has a high affinity for
  divalent cations, so in calcareous soils, a significant portion of the
  EDTA is consumed by binding to the abundant free \(Ca^{2+}\) and
  \(Mg^{2+}\), making it less available to extract the target phosphate
  compounds (Fixen \& Grove, 1993).
\item
  \textbf{Buffering Capacity:} The acetate buffer in the AAE10 solution
  is designed to maintain a consistent pH. However, soils with high
  carbonate content have a strong natural buffering capacity that can
  resist the pH change intended by the extractant, further reducing its
  efficiency in dissolving pH-sensitive P minerals.
\end{enumerate}

This known limitation explains why \(P_{AAE10}\) can underestimate
plant-available P in calcareous soils and supports our finding of a
significant pH-dependence. It underscores that the choice of an
appropriate soil test must take into account the fundamental chemistry
of the soil matrix itself.

\subsection{Hypothesis 2: Characterizing P Desorption
Kinetics}\label{hypothesis-2-characterizing-p-desorption-kinetics}

\textbf{Hypothesis 2a} focused on the methodological feasibility of
characterizing P desorption. It predicted that while the process would
follow first-order kinetics, a non-linear modeling approach would be
more robust than the original linearized method proposed by Flossmann \&
Richter (1982). The results from this thesis unequivocally support this
hypothesis. Our initial attempts to linearize the desorption data failed
systematically, with model intercepts deviating significantly from the
required origin, thus violating a core assumption of the method.

This statistical failure has a fundamental chemical basis. The
linearized model requires an \emph{a priori} estimate of the maximum
desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)), which Flossmann and Richter
approximated by subtracting a water-soluble P measurement from a
stronger chemical extractant (e.g.,
\(P_{desorb} \approx P_{CAL} - P_{H2O}\)). However, in all but the most
severely depleted soils, the P value from the stronger extractant is
orders of magnitude greater than that from water
(\(P_{CAL} >> P_{H2O}\)). This leads to an estimated \(P_{desorb}\) that
is vastly higher than the actual solubility limit of phosphate in the
soil solution. A kinetic desorption curve in water can physically only
plateau at the concentration dictated by mineral solubility; by
providing the model with a theoretical maximum that is chemically
unattainable, the linearization becomes mathematically invalid. This
explains why the linearized approach failed and underscores the
necessity of a method that does not rely on such flawed assumptions.

In contrast, the direct application of a non-linear mixed-effects model
successfully captured the curvilinear nature of P release for nearly all
samples by estimating \(P_{desorb}\) directly from the kinetic data
itself. This confirms that while the foundational concept of first-order
kinetics is sound, modern computational methods that avoid data
transformation provide a far more accurate and statistically valid
approach to parameter estimation (Kuang et al., 2012).

While the non-linear model proved robust, visual inspection of the
kinetic curves revealed that two specific replicates---from the P100 and
P166 treatments at the Ellighausen site---showed markedly higher and
faster P release than their counterparts. To determine whether this was
due to a methodological artifact or true field variability, the standard
soil test results for all replicates at this site were examined
(Figure~\ref{fig-ell-outlier-check-dual-axis}). The diagnostic plot
clearly shows that these same two replicates also registered as
significant outliers for both \(P_{CO_2}\) and \(P_{AAE10}\). This
consistent pattern across three independent measurement techniques
strongly suggests that the deviation is not a result of error in the
kinetic procedure, but rather reflects genuine \textbf{micro-site
heterogeneity}.

Such heterogeneity could arise from several sources. One plausible
explanation, given the decades-long application of Triple-Superphosphate
(primarily monocalcium phosphate), is the presence of residual,
undissolved fertilizer granules in the soil matrix. The accidental
inclusion of even a single such particle in the 10g subsample for a
specific replicate would lead to artificially inflated P values across
all chemical extractions (Fisher, 1925). This highlights a fundamental
challenge in soil analysis and reinforces the importance of robust
modeling. The use of a non-linear \emph{mixed-effects} model is
particularly advantageous in this context, as it is designed to handle
such individual variations by estimating a common overall trend while
allowing for random deviations for each sample, thereby preventing a few
anomalous data points from unduly influencing the overall conclusions
{[}Fisher (1925); Fisher1935; Yates1964; Van Es et al. (2002){]}.

Ultimately, the successful validation of our derived parameters against
established Isotopic Exchange Kinetic (IEK) data further solidifies the
robustness of our methodological approach, demonstrating that this
simpler extraction method effectively captures both the capacity
(\(P_{desorb}\)) and intensity (\emph{k}) aspects of P dynamics.

treatment.}

\end{figure}%

\textbf{Hypothesis 2b} predicted that the derived kinetic parameters
would be significantly influenced by fundamental soil properties, and
this was also strongly supported by the findings. The analysis revealed
a clear and meaningful separation in the drivers of the capacity and
kinetic components. The desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)), representing
the quantity of readily available P, was strongly and negatively
correlated with dithionite-extractable iron and aluminum. This aligns
perfectly with established soil science principles, as these free oxides
provide the primary sorption surfaces that bind P, thereby controlling
the size of the exchangeable pool (Brady \& Weil, 2016; Sposito, 2008).

Conversely, the rate constant (\emph{k}), which represents the speed of
P release, was not primarily driven by the oxide content but was instead
significantly related to soil texture (clay content) and pH. The
negative relationship with clay content is logical, as higher clay
content can increase the tortuosity of diffusion pathways, effectively
slowing the movement of phosphate from the solid phase to the bulk
solution (Nye \& Tinker, 2000). The influence of pH is also consistent
with known phosphate chemistry, as pH governs the speciation of
orthophosphate ions and their affinity for mineral surfaces (Sparks,
2003). These distinct relationships confirm that \(P_{desorb}\) and
\emph{k} are not redundant parameters; they represent fundamentally
different aspects of P availability---the size of the pool and the rate
of access to it---which are governed by different soil-chemical and
physical properties.

\subsection{Hypothesis 3: The Context-Dependent Power of Kinetic
Parameters}\label{hypothesis-3-the-context-dependent-power-of-kinetic-parameters}

The central hypothesis of this thesis predicted that a model
incorporating kinetic parameters (\emph{k} and \(P_{desorb}\)) would
explain a significantly greater proportion of the variance in agronomic
outcomes compared to models based on standard, static STP measurements.
The results provide a nuanced verdict: the hypothesis was strongly
supported in one context, but clearly refuted in others, revealing that
the utility of kinetic parameters is highly dependent on the specific
agronomic question being addressed.

The most compelling support for \textbf{Hypothesis 3} came from the
prediction of the \textbf{P-Balance (\(P_{bal}\))}. In this analysis,
the kinetic model, driven by the desorbable P pool (\(P_{desorb}\)), was
exceptionally powerful, explaining over 57\% of the variance. In stark
contrast, the standard STP models had zero predictive power. This is the
most significant finding of this study. The P-Balance represents the
long-term integration of nutrient inputs and outputs, and the fact that
a kinetic capacity parameter (\(P_{desorb}\)) so perfectly captures this
state demonstrates its superiority for assessing the cumulative effects
of soil management. It suggests that while standard tests reflect the
immediate chemical environment, \(P_{desorb}\) provides a more holistic
measure of the soil's P supply capacity and its legacy from past
fertilization.

However, when predicting yield and P-uptake, the hypothesis was not
supported. The reasons for this are likely multifaceted and highlight
several limitations of the current study. A primary factor is that the P
fertilization levels analyzed (0\%, 100\%, and 167\%) may not have
created conditions where P was the primary limiting factor for yield.
The standard 100\% fertilization rate in the STYCS trial is already
designed for optimal yield, and decades of application at this level
have likely led to significant ``legacy P'' accumulation (Hirte et al.,
2018). Consequently, the 167\% treatment would only add to this surplus,
while the 0\% treatment represents an extreme deficiency. A direct
comparison between kinetic and static tests would be far more powerful
if intermediate levels (e.g., 33\% and 67\%) were included, as this is
the range where the \emph{rate} of P supply is most likely to be a
yield-limiting factor.

Furthermore, the linear mixed-effects models used, while appropriate for
the data structure, could not account for two major sources of
variation. First, as seen in the exploratory analysis in with the
mlr3-model-comparisons, weather variables alone were often strong
predictors of yield. The \texttt{(1\textbar{}year)} and
\texttt{(1\textbar{}Site)} random effects in our models are proxies for
this, bundling complex pedoclimatic information---such as growing degree
days, soil moisture patterns, and soil textural differences---into
single terms. These effects were so large that they overshadowed the
more subtle influence of soil P status. Future studies could improve
predictive power by incorporating specific weather covariates as fixed
effects, allowing for a clearer isolation of the soil P signal.

Second, the assumption of a linear P response is a simplification. As
shown by \textbf{Hirte et al.~(2021)}, crop yield response to P is
non-linear and best described by a saturation curve. This is
particularly relevant given the high yields observed at some sites, such
as Cadenazzo, where relative yields reached up to 300\% in some years, a
level far beyond any plausible linear response to P. A more robust
modeling approach would involve fitting non-linear models, though this
would, as previously noted, require data from the full spectrum of
fertilization treatments.
