# Introduction

## The Complexity of Phosphorus

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all known life, forming a critical part of DNA and energy-transfer molecules [@Berg2019Biochemistry; @NIH2023Phosphorus; @Nelson2021Lehninger]. In soils—where organic, mineral, and aqueous phases interface—its behavior is complex. In the presence of oxygen, P exists almost exclusively as orthophosphate ($PO_4^{3-}$) and its protonated forms ($HPO_4^{2-}$ or $H_2PO_4^{-}$), depending on the soil pH [@Brady2016Soils; @Sparks2003Environmental]. These dissolved phosphate species are highly reactive; they are subject to adsorption onto the surfaces of clays and oxides and can precipitate with cations like calcium, iron, and aluminum to form minerals with low solubility [@Sposito2008Chemistry; @Bohn2002SoilWater; @Hinsinger2001Phosphorus]. Consequently, while total soil P concentrations can be substantial, often ranging from 200 to 3000 mg kg⁻¹, the concentration of orthophosphate in the soil solution—the form directly acquired by plant roots—is typically minuscule, often in the range of 0.001 to 1 mg L⁻¹. This vast difference between the total phosphorus stock and the infinitesimally small plant-available pool represents a central challenge for global agricultural productivity [@Brady2016Soils; @Holford1997SoilP; @Sposito2008Chemistry]. This creates a profound agronomic and environmental dilemma: while the majority of applied P fertilizer is rapidly immobilized in the soil and remains unavailable to crops, the fraction that is lost from fields via runoff and erosion becomes a potent environmental pollutant. This fugitive P is a primary driver of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems, which are often naturally P-limited [@Rast1996Eutrophication; @Abelson1999Dilemma, @Sharpley2003Water].

**Soil organic matter (SOM) adds another layer of complexity to these interactions.** Organic acids released during the decomposition of SOM can compete with phosphate for the same adsorption sites on mineral surfaces, which can increase P concentrations in the soil solution. Furthermore, humic substances can form stable complexes with cations like Al³⁺ and Fe³⁺, preventing them from precipitating phosphate and thereby enhancing its availability [@Stevenson1994Humus; @Gerke2010Humic].

## From Static Measurements to Dynamic Understanding

To manage this challenge, soil testing methods were developed to estimate plant-available phosphorus. These tests are designed to measure two key components of P availability: the **intensity factor**, which is the concentration of P in the soil solution at a given moment, and the **capacity factor**, which represents the pool of weakly adsorbed P that can readily replenish the soil solution. Traditional methods used in Switzerland and the surrounding DACH region, such as extraction with CO₂-saturated water or ammonium acetate EDTA (AAE10), are designed to estimate the size of this readily available P pool (the capacity factor) [@FAL1996Methodenbuch; @VDLUFA2000Methodenbuch; @Schofield1955Potassium].While these tests are invaluable for basic fertility assessment, they do not capture the dynamic nature of P supply. A crucial missing piece of information is the rate at which P is replenished into the soil solution from the solid phase after being taken up by plant roots. This replenishment rate, or **"kinetic factor"**, is vital for sustaining crop growth, especially during periods of high demand [@Nye2000Solute; @Fardeau1991Phosphate, @Frossard2000Processes].

The importance of these dynamics is not a new concept. As early as 1982, **Flossmann and Richter** argued that characterizing the kinetics of P release was essential for refining fertilizer recommendations beyond what static tests alone could offer [@flossmannExtractionMethodCharacterizing1982]. Modern research has reinforced this view, showing that fertilization strategies based solely on maintaining a critical soil test P (STP) concentration can be inefficient [@McDowell2001Approximating; @Rowe2016LegacyP]. In Switzerland, this has led to the accumulation of "legacy P" in many agricultural soils, and understanding the release kinetics of this legacy P is key to both improving nutrient efficiency and protecting water quality [@Hirte2018Relationship]. Furthermore, critical STP levels are not constant; they are influenced by pedoclimatic factors like soil texture and temperature, making a "one-size-fits-all" approach to fertilization suboptimal [@hirteYieldResponseSoil2021; @Sims2005Phosphorus; @Bell2013Factors].

## Objectives and Research Questions

An ideal set of parameters for phosphorus (P) management must move beyond simple agronomic sufficiency to encompass both environmental stewardship and the biophysical realities of nutrient acquisition by plants. To be truly effective, such parameters must: (1) be sensitive to changes in the soil P status resulting from fertilizer inputs and crop removal (the P balance) [@Johnston2001Phosphorus]; (2) correlate with the risk of P loss to the environment (P export) [@Sharpley2000Phosphorus]; and (3), most critically, reflect the kinetic nature of P supply to plant roots, which is governed by the slow diffusion of phosphate in the soil solution [@Nye2000Solute; @Kuang2012Phosphorus].

This thesis hypothesizes that kinetic parameters describing P desorption, derived from a simple laboratory extraction, can serve as effective predictors for agronomic outcomes. To test this, soils were sourced from the long-term Swiss agricultural experiment STYCS [@Hirte2021Yield], which provides an ideal platform for this research. The experiment's multi-decade history has established stable P equilibria across a wide and deliberately created gradient of P availability (from 0% to 167% of recommended fertilization). This allows for robust modeling of crop responses. Furthermore, the trial encompasses six sites with diverse pedoclimatic conditions, ensuring that any findings have broad applicability across different Swiss agricultural landscapes. This study employs a modified version of the Flossmann & Richter kinetic test to derive the desorption rate (k) and the desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$). The performance of these new kinetic parameters will be compared against standard STP methods ($P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$) by addressing the following research questions:

### Research Questions and Hypotheses

#### Research Question 1: How well do standard soil test P (STP) methods predict agronomic outcomes and how do they relate to fundamental soil properties?

-   **Hypothesis 1a (Agronomic Performance):** The standard STP methods ($P_{CO_2}$ and $P_{AAE10}$), which measure the P *capacity* (the size of the readily available pool), will show a significant correlation with the P-Balance, as this is directly influenced by P inputs [@Johnston2001Phosphorus]. However, they will be weak predictors of relative crop yield and P-uptake, as these agronomic outcomes are more dependent on the *rate* of P supply throughout the growing season [@Hirte2021Yield].

-   **Hypothesis 1b (Relation to Soil Properties):** The measured STP values will be positively correlated with soil clay and organic carbon content, reflecting the greater number of sorption sites in these soils [@Brady2016Soils]. Conversely, the P_AAE10 measurement will be negatively correlated with soil pH, particularly in soils with a $pH > 6.8$, due to the chelation of $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$ by the EDTA in the extractant, which reduces its effectiveness [@FAL1996Methodenbuch].

#### Research Question 2: Can P desorption kinetics be reliably characterized for the diverse soils of the STYCS trial, and how do the derived kinetic parameters relate to soil properties?

-   **Hypothesis 2a (Methodological Feasibility):** The P desorption process in the STYCS soils will follow a first-order kinetic model. However, the original linear estimation method proposed by Flossmann & Richter (1982) may be inaccurate because it relies on a potentially overestimated desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$). A non-linear modeling approach will provide more robust and replicable estimates of both the desorption rate constant (*k*) and the desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) [@Kuang2012Phosphorus].

-   **Hypothesis 2b (Relation to Soil Properties):** The kinetic parameters will be significantly influenced by soil composition. The desorbable P pool ($P_{desorb}$) is expected to correlate positively with clay and organic matter content, which provide sorption surfaces. The rate constant (*k*) is expected to be influenced by pH, as the speciation of orthophosphate changes, affecting its interaction with mineral surfaces and its mobility [@Sparks2003Environmental].

#### Research Question 3: Can kinetic parameters significantly improve the prediction of agronomic outcomes compared to standard static STP methods?

-   **Hypothesis 3 (Improved Predictive Power):** Because plant P uptake is fundamentally limited by the slow diffusion of phosphate to the root surface, a dynamic measure is required for accurate prediction [@Nye2000Solute]. Therefore, a model incorporating the kinetic parameters (*k* and $P_{desorb}$), which together describe the replenishment rate of the soil solution, will explain a significantly greater proportion of the variance in relative yield and P-uptake compared to models based solely on the static STP measurements [@Fardeau1991Phosphate; @Frossard2000Processes].
